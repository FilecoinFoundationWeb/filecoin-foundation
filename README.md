# Filecoin Foundation Monorepo

A monorepo containing Filecoin Foundation's web projects, powered by [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo/docs).

## Overview

This monorepo aims to manage multiple applications and packages for Filecoin Foundation's web projects, which can be found in the `apps` directory.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FilecoinFoundationWeb/filecoin-foundation
cd filecoin-foundation
npm install
```

## Development

To start the development server, run `npm run dev`, which is an alias for `turbo dev`. This command will start the development server for all applications and packages in the monorepo.

## Building

To build the monorepo, run `npm run build`. This command will build all applications and packages in the monorepo. Then, `npm run start` will run the development server using the built files.

### Remote caching

We use Turborepoâ€™s remote caching feature to speed up local development. This lets everyone share and access the same build cache on Vercel.

To opt in, run `npx turbo login` to authenticate with Vercel and `turbo link` to link your local repo to the Vercel cache. The next time you run `turbo dev` or `turbo build`, you should see `Remote caching enabled` in the logs.
