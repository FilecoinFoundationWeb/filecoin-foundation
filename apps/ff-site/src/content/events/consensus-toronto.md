  event–it's the annual gathering of the tribes. It's where the most influential

  forward.  In 2025, Consensus brings its flagship event to Toronto, where the
  world's first Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs were born. As North America's
  third-largest tech ecosystem and second-largest financial hub, Toronto unites
  global innovation with transformative technology leadership.  Built on
  CoinDesk's foundation of independent, unbiased journalism, Consensus Toronto

  artificial intelligence, fostering the collaborations that define what's
  next. Don’t miss this moment—join us in Toronto.
