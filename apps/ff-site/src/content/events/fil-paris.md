          description: "Our recent paper written by RIG members and collaborators exhibits the issue of timing games. Consensus participants in decentralized economic systems often find themselves in a privileged position, as block producers. In particular, Proof-of-Stake systems typically sample a block proposer at random and provide them with a slot where they are expected to propose a block. Delaying as late as possible the release of the block maximises rewards to the producer, since they accumulate more fees and MEV in the meantime. Does this incentive lead to a slippery slope where everyone is late? In France, this is known as 'quart d'heure de politesse' ('polite 15 minutes'), where everyone expects everyone else to be late, and adjusts their behavior as a result. It is fitting to discuss this issue in the Paris edition of CryptoEconDay!"

          location: "Lower Deck"
          description: "Trading on decentralized exchanges has been one of the primary use cases for permissionless blockchains with daily trading volume exceeding billions of U.S.~dollars. In the status quo, users broadcast transactions and miners are responsible for composing a block of transactions and picking an execution ordering -- the order in which transactions execute in the exchange. Due to the lack of a regulatory framework, it is common to observe miners exploiting their privileged position by front-running transactions and obtaining risk-fee profits. In this work, we propose to modify the interaction between miners and users and initiate the study of em verifiable sequencing rules. As in the status quo, miners can determine the content of a block; however, they commit to respecting a sequencing rule that constrains the execution ordering and is verifiable (there is a polynomial time algorithm that can verify if the execution ordering satisfies such constraints). Thus in the event a miner deviates from the sequencing rule, anyone can generate a proof of non-compliance. We ask if there are sequencing rules that limit price manipulation from miners in a two-token liquidity pool exchange. Our first result is an impossibility theorem: for any sequencing rule, there is an instance of user transactions where the miner can obtain non-zero risk-free profits. In light of this impossibility result, our main result is a verifiable sequencing rule that provides execution price guarantees for users. In particular, for any user transaction A, it ensures that either (1) the execution price of A is at least as good as if A was the only transaction in the block, or (2) the execution price of A is worse than this standalone price and the miner does not gain (or lose) when including A in the block."

A lot of discussion has gone into friendlier UX & scaling blockchain over the past year, culminating in account abstraction & ZK proofs. However, the next frontier for computing is really at the data layer - to build truly decentralized applications that can run at internet scale requires more efficient off-chain computation (that isn't a centralized backend!). This opens up the door to so many opportunities unavailable in the Web2 world including ML DAOs, decentralized AI, DeSci & applications that take advantage of both the features of blockchain and the power of distributed compute (eg. Waterlily.ai)."
