title: "Filecoin's 5th Birthday!"
description: "Five years ago, Filecoin launched with a bold mission: to create a
  decentralized, efficient, and resilient foundation for humanity’s information.
  Since then, we’ve grown into a thriving global ecosystem that built the
  world’s largest decentralized storage network. Now, we’re raising a toast to
  how far we’ve come together — and to the even bigger possibilities ahead.
  Expect reflections on the past and look-aheads to the future, reunions with
  familiar faces, and opportunities to meet new community members. Happy
  Birthday, Filecoin!"
