title: Filecoin's 5th Birthday!
description: "Five years ago, Filecoin launched with a bold mission: to create a
  decentralized, efficient, and resilient foundation for humanity’s information.
  Since then, we’ve grown into a thriving global ecosystem that built the
  world’s largest decentralized storage network. Now, we’re raising a toast to
  how far we’ve come — and to the even bigger possibilities that lie ahead
  together with this community. Expect engaging reflections on the past and
  look-aheads to the future, reunions with familiar faces, and opportunities to
  meet new community members. Happy Birthday, Filecoin!"
