title: Agentic Brunch - ERC-8004
description: "​Agentic Brunch is a relaxed, builder-focused gathering for teams
  working on ERC-8004 agents, Agentic Finance, gaming, trading, and agent-native
  services on Ethereum.  ​We’ll go deep on the emerging agentic economy: how
  autonomous agents are registered, discovered, coordinated, and trusted; how
  they interact with protocols and services; and how standards like ERC-8004
  (identity & reputation) and x402 (payments) fit together to enable agents as
  first-class economic actors."
