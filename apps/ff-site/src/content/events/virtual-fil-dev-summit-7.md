      description: "This track dives into how Filecoin can supercharge adoption
        through seamless integrations, stronger tooling, and real-world client
        success. Explore what’s working (and what’s not) in the client pipeline,
        identify new opportunities for growth, and shape the incentives that
        will drive faster uptake. Join hands-on workshops on cross-chain data
        bridge (CCDB) evolution and discover how Filecoin is expanding usability
        across the entire web3 landscape- aligning with IPFS, connecting with
        chains like AVAX and Solana, and empowering builders everywhere to
        leverage Filecoin storage as the default standard. The track will also
        look ahead to what’s next for storage across DePin and AI, including new
        opportunities like powering AI workloads and storing AI data on
        Filecoin. "
