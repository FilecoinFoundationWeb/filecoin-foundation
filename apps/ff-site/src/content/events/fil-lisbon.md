          description: >-
            Consensus lies at the heart of blockchain networks: while enabling
            the decentralisation we're working towards, it also imposes
            scalability constraints. In the 15 months since its creation,
            Consensus Lab has been working on novel solutions to scaling
            blockchains in general and Filecoin in particular, ranging from our
            flagship Inter Planetary Consensus project to multi-threaded
            execution in FVM. Join us in Lisbon to get a sneak peek into the
            future of Filecoin and shape our directions, all during an afternoon
            of good talks, great discussions, and cold drinks. Check the website

            We're working to build a resilient platform for distributed storage

            challenges to redecentralizing the web. The Filecoin Foundation for
            the Decentralized Web's Danny O'Brien talks about lessons learned
            from past decentralization projects, and some hot areas of research

          description: >-
            Alongside the FVM (Filecoin Virtual Machine), the Filecoin Retrieval
            Market is one of the most important priorities for Filecoin. It
            unlocks the possibility of mass adoption for the Filecoin Network.
            The Retrieval Markets Working Group (RMWG) consists of many teams
            around the globe, all working on building blocks of a decentralised
            CDN for the Filecoin Network. The Retrieval Markets Summit in Lisbon
            will give each team the chance to present what they have built so
            far and their vision for the future. It will also allow the teams a
            chance to meet each other and discuss how their solutions can work
            together. Head to retrieval. market to find out more about the teams
            and their work. There will be two themes at this event. RMWG 2022
            launches and updates Retrieval Incentives for the Filecoin Network
            This event will include time at the beginning and the end to talk to
            each other more informally over some food and drinks. Check the
            website for more information!

            interdisciplinary field of study is at the core of every Web3

            computer science, network science, statistics, economics, and

            cryptoeconomics will play a bigger role in coordinating human and
