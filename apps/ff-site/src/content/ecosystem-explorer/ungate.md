Ungate Wukong integrates Filecoin by archiving AI-generated proofs on decentralized storage. The workflow involves:

1. Proof Generation: AI agents within Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) generate cryptographic proofs documenting their actions.
2. Decentralized Storage: Proofs are stored initially via EigenDA for immediate availability, then archived on Filecoin.
3. Validator Verification: Independent validators on EigenLayer retrieve proofs from Filecoin, verifying agent actions transparently and securely.
4. Immutable Records: Validated proofs anchor on-chain as cryptographic references, allowing user and auditor verification via Wukongâ€™s Proof Explorer interface.
