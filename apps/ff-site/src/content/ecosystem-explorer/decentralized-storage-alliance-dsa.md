The DSA is a first-of-its-kind, member-led industry organization to drive awareness and adoption of decentralized technologies, such as Filecoin, IPFS, and libp2p, and help enterprises in Web2 make the transition to Web3 through education, advocacy, and best practices. Filecoin Foundation is a founding member of the DSA, alongside Protocol Labs, AMD, EY, and Seagate.
