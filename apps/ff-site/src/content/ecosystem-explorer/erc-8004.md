The Ethereum trustless agent builder community is using Filecoin Pin for onchain agent identity, reputation, and discovery. Agent0 created by ERC-8004 author Marco De Rossi, is an open source SDK that makes it easy for developers to create and manage onchain AI agents. By pinning agents’ 8004 metadata and other agent data on Filecoin Onchain Cloud, Agent0 ensures that every agent’s information is stored verifiably and tamper-free, enabling open discovery without centralized catalogs or gatekeepers.
