KYVE is a Proof of Stake (PoS) Layer 1 blockchain built with the [Cosmos SDK](https://v1.cosmos.network/sdk). It has two layers: the Chain Layer, and the Protocol Layer, each with their own node infrastructure.

The Chain Layer which is the consensus layer, is the backbone of KYVE and is an entirely sovereign Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchain built with/on [Ignite](https://ignitedao.io/about-ignite-dao/). It’s run by independent nodes, which enable users to support and secure the KYVE blockchain.

Sitting on top of the consensus layer is the Protocol Layer, which enables the actual use case of KYVE’s data lake. This includes data pools, funding, staking, and delegation.

The protocol layer has its own protocol validators, which are responsible for collecting data from a data source, bundling and uploading it to any decentralized storage solution, then validating it and keeping track of which data is truly valid for its users to tap into. This enables KYVE to store any data permanently and in a decentralized manner, creating a Web3 data lake.

KYVE is using Filecoin Onchain Cloud to resiliently store chain data from [Celestia](https://celestiaproject.space/) and [Story Protocol](https://www.story.foundation/) across a decentralized network of Filecoin storage providers.
