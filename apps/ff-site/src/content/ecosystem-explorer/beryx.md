Beryx provides a real-time, user-friendly interface for exploring, interpreting, and interacting with Filecoin’s on-chain data. It indexes raw blockchain information—blocks, messages, actors, contracts, deals, and state transitions—and transforms it into clear, reliable dashboards for both technical and non-technical users. This indexed layer lets anyone track network activity, inspect transactions, monitor storage providers, and follow contract interactions as they occur.

Through deep integration with the Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM), Beryx enables users to read contract state, verify deployed contracts, and interact with smart contracts using wallets like MetaMask and Ledger. Developers can test, debug, and showcase FVM applications without setup complexity, while features such as contract verification and real-time gas estimation draw directly from Filecoin’s live network data.

Built for the broader Filecoin community—developers, storage providers, ecosystem contributors, and curious users—Beryx serves as a dependable point of reference. It delivers a fast, intuitive, and trustworthy explorer that supports high-impact ecosystem projects with the clarity and insights they need to understand and engage with the network.

In essence, Beryx uses Filecoin as its operational backbone: every insight, tool, and visual dashboard is powered directly by the live Filecoin chain.
