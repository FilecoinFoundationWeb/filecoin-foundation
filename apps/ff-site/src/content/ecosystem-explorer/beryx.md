Beryx uses the Filecoin network by serving as a real-time, user-friendly interface to explore, interpret, and interact with Filecoin’s on-chain data. It indexes data directly from the Filecoin blockchain—blocks, messages, actors, contracts, deals, and state transitions—and transforms that raw information into clear, reliable dashboards for both technical and non-technical users. Through this indexed layer, Beryx enables anyone to track network activity, inspect transactions, monitor storage providers, and follow contract interactions as they happen.

On the smart contract side, Beryx integrates with the Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM), allowing users to read contract state, verify deployed contracts, and interact with them using wallets like MetaMask and Ledger. This lowers the barrier for developers who want to test, debug, or showcase FVM-based applications without additional setup. Features such as contract verification and a live gas estimator rely entirely on Filecoin network data, ensuring transparency and accurate guidance for builders.

Designed for the broader Filecoin community—developers, storage providers, ecosystem contributors, and curious users—Beryx acts as a central, dependable point of reference. It provides a fast, visually approachable, and reliable Filecoin explorer. Instead of functioning as a library dependency, Beryx supports high-impact ecosystem projects by giving them the clarity, insight, and real-time data access needed to understand and engage with the network.

In essence, Beryx uses Filecoin as its core data source and operational backbone: everything the platform offers, from chain exploration to contract tools, is powered by the live Filecoin network.
