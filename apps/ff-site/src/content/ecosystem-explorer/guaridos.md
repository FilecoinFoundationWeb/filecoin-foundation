GuaridOS integrates Filecoin decentralized storage as the backbone of its privacy suite:

Secure Email & Identity – Encrypted mail and user identity metadata are stored on Filecoin, ensuring immutability and censorship-resistance.

Private File Vaults – User files and attachments are stored as content-addressed deals on Filecoin, guaranteeing verifiable, tamper-proof backups.

Redundant & Auditable – Filecoin’s proof-of-replication and proof-of-space-time provide auditable evidence that data remains intact over time.

Interoperability – Combined with IPFS for fast retrieval, while Filecoin handles the long-term, verifiable persistence.

By anchoring GuaridOS core data on Filecoin, we deliver end-to-end privacy, long-term durability, and trustless verification for every email and file stored.
