GuaridOS integrates Filecoin decentralized storage as the backbone of its privacy suite:

- **Secure Email & Identity** – Stores encrypted mail and user identity metadata on Filecoin, ensuring immutability and censorship resistance.
- **Private File Vaults** – Keeps user files and attachments as content-addressed deals on Filecoin, guaranteeing verifiable, tamper-proof backups.
- **Redundant & Auditable** – Relies on Filecoin’s proof-of-replication and proof-of-space-time to provide auditable evidence that data remains intact over time.
- **Interoperability** – Combines IPFS for fast retrieval with Filecoin for long-term, verifiable persistence.

By anchoring its core data on Filecoin, GuaridOS delivers end-to-end privacy, long-term durability, and trustless verification for every email and file stored.
