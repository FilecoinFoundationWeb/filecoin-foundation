CDID Protocol (Creative Decentralized Identity) uses Filecoin and IPFS as the foundation for creator identity, licensing metadata, and programmable royalty logic. Every creator profile and work is anchored on IPFS, with long-term persistence secured by Filecoin. This ensures tamper-proof attribution, transparent ownership, and global accessibility for rights and royalty records.

Applications such as Gigginâ€™ (a live music AI agent), Epic Sound Streaming, and other distribution and analysis platforms can retrieve verified creator data directly from CDID. By positioning Filecoin/IPFS as the backbone of creative infrastructure, CDID enables trust, compliance, and interoperability across the next generation of creator-focused platforms.
