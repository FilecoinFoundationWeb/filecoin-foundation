The Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM) brings smart-contract programmability to the Filecoin network, enabling developers to build applications that utilize verifiable storage as a native primitive.

FVM powers new classes of applications such as dataDAOs, perpetual storage, and financial services for storage providers—including collateral lending, liquid staking, and insurance protocols. It also enables decentralized compute (via [Bacalhau](https://bacalhau.org/)), Layer 2 networks like reputation systems, and incentive-aligned content delivery networks (such as [STRN](https://strn.network/)).

A growing ecosystem of builders is already deploying production applications on FVM. With available technical and business support, you can launch value-generating smart-contract systems on Filecoin mainnet today.
