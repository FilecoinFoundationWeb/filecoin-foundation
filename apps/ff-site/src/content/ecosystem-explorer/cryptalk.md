Our project is currently in demo phase.

Decentralized Message Attachments:
Voice messages, images and file attachments will be stored on the Filecoin network. Content addressing will make sure that files are immutable and verifiable, and enhance the protocol's capability to handle large files

Extended Message History:
Long term message history will be archived on Filecoin. XMTP handles recent messages while older conversations is better to be moved to a permanent storage.
