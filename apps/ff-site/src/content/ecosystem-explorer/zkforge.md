. We just deployed AI Training Data Immortalization for ZKForge
. Every conversation is now stored permanently using filecoin storage stack
. The full process is decentralized and verifiable on-chain

How it works:

User sends message → AI responds with insights  
Message is uploaded via Lighthouse SDK → Gets unique CID  
IPFS stores the content → Filecoin storage deals are created  
Data is cryptographically verifiable on-chain  


Key Features:
. Each message has its own CID and proof
. Full chat session archives also stored
. No centralized server – 100% Web3 data
. Public, immutable, and attributed to the contributor

Why this matters:
. Contributions to train the AI become permanent
. Anyone can verify and retrieve their own training data
. All powered by Filecoin + IPFS via @FilFoundation ecosystem tools

ZKForge is building transparent, verifiable AI – one message at a time.
