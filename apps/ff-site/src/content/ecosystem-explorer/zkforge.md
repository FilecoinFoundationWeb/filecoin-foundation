ZKForge has just deployed AI Training Data Immortalization, ensuring that every conversation is permanently stored using the Filecoin storage stack. The full pipeline is decentralized, verifiable on-chain, and designed for privacy through zkSTARK-based infrastructure.

User messages and AI responses are uploaded via the Lighthouse SDK, assigned unique CIDs, stored on IPFS, and sealed as Filecoin storage deals. The result is a tamper-proof, cryptographically verifiable archive of all contributions—without relying on any centralized server.

**Key features:**

- Every message receives its own CID and proof
- Full chat session archives also stored
- 100% Web3 data pipeline — no centralized servers
- Public, immutable, and attributable to each contributor

**Why this matters:**

- AI training data becomes permanent and auditable
- Users can independently verify and retrieve their own contributions
- Powered end-to-end by Filecoin + IPFS through the Filecoin ecosystem

ZKForge is building transparent, verifiable AI — one message at a time.
