FilDOS is a meaning-first decentralized drive built on Filecoin. It allows users—and their AI agents—to store, search, and share data using semantic understanding rather than opaque identifiers like CIDs. By combining decentralized storage with embedded AI intelligence, FilDOS turns Web3 storage into a human- and agent-friendly knowledge layer.

Today, decentralized storage is difficult to navigate: files are referenced by cryptic CIDs, metadata is minimal, UX is fragmented, and collaboration requires exposing low-level Web3 tooling. Finding files or enabling agents to operate on stored data is unnecessarily complex.

FilDOS solves these challenges by adding a semantic, AI-native interface over Filecoin—making decentralized storage searchable by meaning, easy to share, and ready for autonomous AI workflows.
