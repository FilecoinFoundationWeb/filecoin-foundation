#### What it does
FILDOS is a revolutionary decentralized storage platform built on Filecoin that enables users to store, search, and share files by meaning rather than cryptic identifiers like CIDs. It combines the power of blockchain technology with AI-driven semantic search to create a truly human-centric storage experience.

#### The problem it solves
Managing and retrieving files across decentralized storage is clunky, with poor UX and no semantic intelligence. Users struggle to find the right files, collaborate, and share without exposing CIDs or handling complex Web3 tooling. Expand beyond files to enable AI agents to directly use this storage layer for autonomous workflows.
