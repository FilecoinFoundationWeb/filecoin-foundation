Akave is a decentralized protocol that empowers businesses and individuals with a robust storage layer and advanced data management tools for managing on-chain data lakes. Designed to combine decentralized infrastructure with ease of use, Akave enables users to gain full control of their data assets while unlocking new possibilities for data privacy, security, and monetization. With an intuitive interface and seamless integration capabilities, Akave bridges the gap between traditional data management systems and the decentralized web.

Akave is harnessing Filecoin Onchain Cloud’s warm storage service to extend verifiability beyond hot storage into a new decentralized backup and archiving tier. This new tier is designed for AI, IoT, ML, and compliance workloads that need durable, auditable, lower-cost storage. Akave already offers an S3-compatible platform, integrity proofs, and erasure-coded durability and the Filecoin integration expands these guarantees giving users an affordable and more scalable option for long-term retention without compromising verifiability.
