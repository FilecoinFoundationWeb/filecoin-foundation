Storacha is the latest innovation in decentralized data storage, developed by the minds at Protocol Labs. By integrating the best features of web3.storage and Saturn (dCDN), Storacha is a blazing-fast, user-owned, and verifiable hot data storage and retrieval system built on the Filecoin network.

Storacha has already managed petabytes of data for various open web projects, establishing itself as a leading production-grade storage solution in the decentralized internet space.

## Key Features of Storacha

Storacha offers decentralized hot object storage and retrieval, optimized for large-scale data on the open web. Here are some of the unique approaches that set us apart:

- **User Controlled Authorization Networks (UCAN):** Offline-first, cryptographic keypair-based tokens for user-owned storage with flexible permissioning.
- **Battle-Tested Production Systems:** Leveraging experience from web3.storage and Saturn to build systems capable of efficiently storing and retrieving petabytes of data.
- **IPFS Compatibility:** Seamless integration and migration with IPFS, ensuring trustless data handling and efficient retrieval.
- **Filecoin Integration:** Utilizing Filecoin for redundant, geographically distributed storage with unmatched verifiable aggregation pipelines.
