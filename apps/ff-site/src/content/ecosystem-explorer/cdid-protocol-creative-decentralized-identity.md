CDID Protocol uses Filecoin/IPFS as the storage foundation for creator identity, licensing metadata, and programmable royalty logic. Every creator profile and work registered through CDID is anchored on IPFS with long-term persistence secured by Filecoin. This ensures tamper-proof attribution, transparent ownership, and global accessibility for rights and royalty records. Filecoin’s decentralized storage guarantees permanence while allowing applications like Giggin’ (our live music AI agent), Epic Sound Streaming, and other music distribution and analysis apps to retrieve verified creator data. CDID positions Filecoin/IPFS as the backbone of next-generation creative infrastructure, enabling multiple platforms to build on top with trust, compliance, and interoperability.
