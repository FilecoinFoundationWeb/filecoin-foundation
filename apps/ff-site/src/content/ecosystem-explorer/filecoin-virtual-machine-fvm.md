  title: Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM) – Smart Contracts & Developer Tools
  description: "Build on Filecoin with FVM: deploy smart contracts, dataDAOs,
    decentralized compute, and Layer 2 apps while unlocking the potential of an
    open data economy."

The FVM unlocks boundless possibilities, ranging from dataDAOs, to perpetual storage, to financial services for storage providers (e.g. collateral lending, liquid staking, insurance protocols), to [decentralized compute](https://bacalhau.org/) and Layer 2 networks (such as reputation systems, and incentive-aligned [content delivery networks](https://strn.network/), and more.

Bring your project to FVM and build alongside a large cohort of builders, with supporting business and technical resources, to deploy the first batch of value-generating applications to the Filecoin mainnet!
