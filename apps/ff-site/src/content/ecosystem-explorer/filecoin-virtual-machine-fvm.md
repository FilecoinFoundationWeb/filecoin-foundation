The FVM unlocks boundless possibilities: from dataDAOs and perpetual storage, to financial services for storage providers (e.g. collateral lending, liquid staking, insurance protocols).
It also enables [decentralized compute](https://bacalhau.org/), Layer 2 networks (such as reputation systems), and incentive-aligned [content delivery networks](https://strn.network/).

Join a growing cohort of builders on FVM. With technical and business support available, you can deploy value-generating applications to the Filecoin mainnet today.
