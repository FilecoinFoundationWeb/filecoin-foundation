Before the launch of FVM, OpenGate introduced CryptoBear, the first NFT project within the Filecoin ecosystem that accepts FIL as payment. The number of NFT holders has already exceeded 5000, and we are currently in the process of transferring all NFTs to FVM. As an NFT incubation platform, OpenGate possesses a wealth of IP resources（more than 170), including celebrities, artists, and anime. We will gradually release NFT projects on FVM in the future.In addition, OpenGate has also launched the FNS domain project for the FIL blockchain, with a current total registration of 40,000 domains. These domains can be used as storage accounts.
