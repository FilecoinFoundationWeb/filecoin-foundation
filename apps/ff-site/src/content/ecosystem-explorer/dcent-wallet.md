- One stop shop for seamless User experience
  - Not like other wallets, D’CENT wallet supports various address type in Filecoin network (f1 and f4) where Filecoin holders can manage FIL in single wallet.
  - Through in-App browser (aka Discovery), FIL holders can connect various dApp services by few clicks.
  - FIL users can manage the assets on-the-go and confirm the transaction by scanning the fingerprint, instead of entering traditional PIN numbers.
- Ultimate Security
  - FIL holders’ private key is encrypted and saved at dedicated secure chip which has used in various security industries in more than decades.
  - Although firmware update is not mandatory (for better UX), D’CENT will check and verify its firmware when users update it.
  - Fingerprint is unique identification data that offers higher security compare with PIN number entry.
- Others
  - D’CENT is #1 hardware wallet in Korea and have established strong partnership with KOLs including Youtubers. Through credibility that D’CENT has built and KOLs network, increasing Filecoin awareness or any updates to local market should be more effective than other partners, plus similar strategy could be implemented in other leading countries like USA, Europe including UK and Asian countries like Japan and Australia.
