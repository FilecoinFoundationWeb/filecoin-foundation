The D'CENT wallet is a one-stop shop for seamless user experience. Unlike other wallets, D'CENT supports various address types on the Filecoin network (f1 and f4) where Filecoin holders can manage FIL in a single wallet. Through an in-app browser (Discovery), FIL holders can connect to various dApp services with a few clicks, and users can manage the assets on the go and confirm the transaction by scanning their fingerprint, instead of entering traditional PINs.

The D'CENT wallet also offers the ultimate security. The user's private key is encrypted, and fingerprint identification provides a higher level of protection compared to PIN entry.

D'CENT has become the top hardware wallet in Korea through its strong partnerships with KOLs and its product credibility.
