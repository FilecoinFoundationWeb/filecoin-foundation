⭐ Thanks for joining the [Filecoin ecosystem at Consensus](https://hub.fil.org/consensus-24)! FF hosted the Filecoin booth on the Consensus show floor, where attendees connected with community members and discovered how the Filecoin network enables decentralized AI, compute, and DePIN.

📹 The Defiant’s ETHDenver documentary is now stored on Filecoin. On a recent [DWeb Decoded episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nVyrlf4tqM), The Defiant team uploaded their documentary –– [Meet The Gigabrains Shaping The Future Of Web3](https://youtu.be/ZwRfWwZgyus?si=fN4j49c-3im9FQkS) –– to the Filecoin network. Decentralized storage provides media organizations with increased data security and redundancy, ensuring that their valuable files are protected against single points of failure or data breaches.
