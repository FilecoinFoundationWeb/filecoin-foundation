### Fil Plus

- Introducing the [Fil+ Allocator page](/filecoin-plus/allocators). Allocators play a key role in the Fil+ program by verifying and onboarding real client data to the Filecoin network, incentivizing the storage of useful data.

- The Fil+ team will lead the Fil+ Updates and Gathering track at Fil Dev Summit. This workshop will highlight recent Fil+ updates, showcase tooling developments, and discuss key topics with allocators.
