**[The Defiant](https://thedefiant.io/news/defi/the-defiant-to-preserve-article-archives-on-filecoin) is now safeguarding its entire article archive and future content on Filecoin.** With storage facilitated by [Akave](/ecosystem-explorer/akave), and support from FF, this move ensures its journalism remains immutable, verifiable, and accessible, protecting against link rot and content loss. Readers will soon see a “Preserved on Filecoin” marker on archived articles.
