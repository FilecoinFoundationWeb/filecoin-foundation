### Introduction 

Last year marked five years since Filecoin mainnet launch, a milestone that underscored both how far the network has come and the growing urgency of our work to build a better, more resilient web. 

In 2025, global [internet outages](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/oct/20/amazon-web-services-aws-outage-hits-dozens-websites-apps) exposed the fragility of centralized cloud providers. The rapid rise of autonomous agents [heightened demand](https://fil.org/blog/ai-agents-and-why-storage-is-the-key-to-smarter-more-reliable-agents) for decentralized infrastructure while [intesifying questions](https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/08/environmental-groups-call-for-halt-to-new-data-center-construction/) around data center efficiency and sustainability. And perhaps most striking, a [massive internet outage](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/18/cloudflare-down-outage-traffic-spike-x-chatgpt.html) occurred on the same day as the Filecoin Onchain Cloud launch –– a powerful reminder that the need for decentralized storage is becoming increasingly clear.

As the Filecoin community looks toward 2026 with renewed energy to meet mounting demand, Filecoin Foundation (FF) seeks to rally the Filecoin ecosystem around [FF’s top-level ecosystem-facing objective](https://fil.org/blog/filecoin-foundation-s-vision-and-strategic-priorities-for-2025): 

**make Filecoin work seamlessly and find product-market fit (PMF)**.

But first, let’s look back at 2025 and celebrate the achievements of Filecoin Foundation and the broader ecosystem –– from major network upgrades and infrastructure improvements to data onboarding partnerships, governance initiatives, and more. 

We’re proud to share our progress and grateful to continue supporting the Filecoin ecosystem throughout 2026.

### What is Filecoin Foundation? 

Filecoin Foundation’s mission is to preserve humanity’s most important information by facilitating the open source governance of the Filecoin network, funding research and development projects related to Filecoin and decentralized technologies, and supporting the growth of the Filecoin ecosystem and community. 

FF’s vision is to create a world in which Filecoin and related decentralized technologies safeguard knowledge , empower users, and embed core civil liberties and human rights — such as free speech and privacy — into the fabric of the world’s technological infrastructure. We want to build a decentralized, efficient, and robust foundation for the future of the Web.

In 2017, the creators of Filecoin envisioned a governance body to serve as a long-term steward for the Filecoin network, modeled after other open source foundations, such as the Mozilla and Linux Foundations. The Filecoin ecosystem is fully decentralized, and that means that FF does not dictate the direction of the Filecoin ecosystem. Rather, FF’s goal is to bring together and empower the Filecoin community, including storage providers, data clients, token holders, developers, and other ecosystem participants. This includes facilitating the Filecoin network’s open source governance process, providing funding to teams building in the ecosystem, hosting events to convene ecosystem participants, and running critical security programs, as well as supporting the Filecoin ecosystem in other ways.

In this report, you’ll read about the ways that Filecoin Foundation supported the Filecoin community in 2025 and learn about FF’s strategic priorities in 2026. FF’s top ecosystem-facing objective in 2026 remains to make Filecoin work seamlessly and find product-market fit. But FF cannot dictate what the Filecoin community should do to pursue these objectives. Instead, FF’s strategic priorities in 2026 are about mobilizing the ecosystem to achieve those goals. This includes driving a process to align the community on the most important actions to make Filecoin work seamlessly and find product-market fit, and supporting projects that will help accomplish those goals.

But before we dive into our plans for 2026, let’s take a look back at the achievements of Filecoin Foundation in 2025. 

### Ecosystem Funding: Supporting the Filecoin Community

#### Ecosystem Support by the Numbers 

* 150+ teams supported through FF funding and grants 
* 386 hackathon submissions for Filecoin-related projects  

Filecoin Foundation supports the growth and innovation of the Filecoin ecosystem by funding research and development projects for decentralized technologies. Through diverse funding mechanisms –– from collaborations and grants to public goods funding and tooling support –– FF ensures that builders, contributors, and researchers have the resources they need to advance the Filecoin network. 

FF also plays an active role in supporting the ecosystem’s Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RetroPGF) program, [introduced](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/unveiling-fil-retropgf-1-retroactively-funding-filecoin-public-goods/) in March 2024 to enhance Filecoin’s economic mechanisms and address funding gaps for high-impact contributions. As an open source protocol, public good funding is an important tool for strengthening shared infrastructure and supporting long-term ecosystem health. FF’s role in retroactive funding helps ensure that impactful projects can continue to operate and expand. 

The second round of RetroPGF concluded [in December 2024](https://medium.com/cryptoeconlab/a-deepdive-into-fil-retropgf-2-results-880234699fe4), allocating 270,000 FIL to 97 projects to recognize critical contributions across storage operations, developer infrastructure, programmable data, retrieval markets, and decentralized consensus. The third round of RetroPGF concluded in December 2025, allocating 500,000 FIL to 91 projects.
