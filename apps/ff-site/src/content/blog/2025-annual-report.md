### Introduction 

Last year marked five years since Filecoin mainnet launch, a milestone that underscored both how far the network has come and the growing urgency of our work to build a better, more resilient web. 

In 2025, global [internet outages](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/oct/20/amazon-web-services-aws-outage-hits-dozens-websites-apps) exposed the fragility of centralized cloud providers. The rapid rise of autonomous agents [heightened demand](https://fil.org/blog/ai-agents-and-why-storage-is-the-key-to-smarter-more-reliable-agents) for decentralized infrastructure while [intesifying questions](https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/08/environmental-groups-call-for-halt-to-new-data-center-construction/) around data center efficiency and sustainability. And perhaps most striking, a [massive internet outage](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/18/cloudflare-down-outage-traffic-spike-x-chatgpt.html) occurred on the same day as the Filecoin Onchain Cloud launch –– a powerful reminder that the need for decentralized storage is becoming increasingly clear.

As the Filecoin community looks toward 2026 with renewed energy to meet mounting demand, Filecoin Foundation (FF) seeks to rally the Filecoin ecosystem around [FF’s top-level ecosystem-facing objective](https://fil.org/blog/filecoin-foundation-s-vision-and-strategic-priorities-for-2025): 

**make Filecoin work seamlessly and find product-market fit (PMF)**.

But first, let’s look back at 2025 and celebrate the achievements of Filecoin Foundation and the broader ecosystem –– from major network upgrades and infrastructure improvements to data onboarding partnerships, governance initiatives, and more. 

We’re proud to share our progress and grateful to continue supporting the Filecoin ecosystem throughout 2026.

### What is Filecoin Foundation? 

Filecoin Foundation’s mission is to preserve humanity’s most important information by facilitating the open source governance of the Filecoin network, funding research and development projects related to Filecoin and decentralized technologies, and supporting the growth of the Filecoin ecosystem and community. 

FF’s vision is to create a world in which Filecoin and related decentralized technologies safeguard knowledge , empower users, and embed core civil liberties and human rights — such as free speech and privacy — into the fabric of the world’s technological infrastructure. We want to build a decentralized, efficient, and robust foundation for the future of the Web.

In 2017, the creators of Filecoin envisioned a governance body to serve as a long-term steward for the Filecoin network, modeled after other open source foundations, such as the Mozilla and Linux Foundations. The Filecoin ecosystem is fully decentralized, and that means that FF does not dictate the direction of the Filecoin ecosystem. Rather, FF’s goal is to bring together and empower the Filecoin community, including storage providers, data clients, token holders, developers, and other ecosystem participants. This includes facilitating the Filecoin network’s open source governance process, providing funding to teams building in the ecosystem, hosting events to convene ecosystem participants, and running critical security programs, as well as supporting the Filecoin ecosystem in other ways.

In this report, you’ll read about the ways that Filecoin Foundation supported the Filecoin community in 2025 and learn about FF’s strategic priorities in 2026. FF’s top ecosystem-facing objective in 2026 remains to make Filecoin work seamlessly and find product-market fit. But FF cannot dictate what the Filecoin community should do to pursue these objectives. Instead, FF’s strategic priorities in 2026 are about mobilizing the ecosystem to achieve those goals. This includes driving a process to align the community on the most important actions to make Filecoin work seamlessly and find product-market fit, and supporting projects that will help accomplish those goals.

But before we dive into our plans for 2026, let’s take a look back at the achievements of Filecoin Foundation in 2025.

### Ecosystem Funding: Supporting the Filecoin Community

#### Ecosystem Support by the Numbers 

* 150+ teams supported through FF funding and grants 
* 386 hackathon submissions for Filecoin-related projects  

Filecoin Foundation supports the growth and innovation of the Filecoin ecosystem by funding research and development projects for decentralized technologies. Through diverse funding mechanisms –– from collaborations and grants to public goods funding and tooling support –– FF ensures that builders, contributors, and researchers have the resources they need to advance the Filecoin network. 

FF also plays an active role in supporting the ecosystem’s Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RetroPGF) program, [introduced](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/unveiling-fil-retropgf-1-retroactively-funding-filecoin-public-goods/) in March 2024 to enhance Filecoin’s economic mechanisms and address funding gaps for high-impact contributions. As an open source protocol, public good funding is an important tool for strengthening shared infrastructure and supporting long-term ecosystem health. FF’s role in retroactive funding helps ensure that impactful projects can continue to operate and expand. 

The second round of RetroPGF concluded [in December 2024](https://medium.com/cryptoeconlab/a-deepdive-into-fil-retropgf-2-results-880234699fe4), allocating 270,000 FIL to 97 projects to recognize critical contributions across storage operations, developer infrastructure, programmable data, retrieval markets, and decentralized consensus. The third round of RetroPGF concluded in December 2025, allocating 500,000 FIL to 91 projects.

### Governance: Shaping a New Era of Filecoin Governance 

#### Governance by the Numbers 

* 3 network upgrades in FY2025
* 13 FIPs and 1 Filecoin Requests for Comments (FRC) executed across upgrades
* 780+ PiB of DataCap distributed  

Governance of the Filecoin ecosystem is at an inflection point.Since the network’s inception, Filecoin’s open source governance has been anchored in the Filecoin Improvement Proposal (FIP) process. As the network has scaled, the demands on governance have expanded as well. This year, FF continued to strengthen the governance framework to meet the needs of a maturing network while staying true to its decentralized, open source principles.

As an open source project, Filecoin is governed through community-driven processes rooted in openness, collaboration, and shared stewardship. FF supports this decentralized model by facilitating transparent [forums for discussion](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs), broadening and diversifying participation, and ensuring that community input meaningfully informs the evolution of the core protocol.

#### Constellation Program

In late 2025, FF’s Governance team formally launched the [Constellation Program](https://fil.org/blog/help-us-shape-a-new-era-of-filecoin-governance), a structured, community-driven, and multi-phase initiative to evolve and modernize how governance works across the Filecoin ecosystem.[ ](https://fil.org/blog/help-us-shape-a-new-era-of-filecoin-governance)The program includes three phases:

1. **Nebula:** This phase establishes the foundations of governance, including incentives and early-stage experiments. 
2. **Nexus:** This phase is focused on scaling distributed governance mechanisms to support broader participation and coordination.
3. **Galaxy:** The final phase is centered around institutionalizing stable governance structures. 

The initial Nebula phase kicked off in November at FDS-7, diving into [Filecoin community governance evolution](https://youtu.be/ipAkEFlolD0?si=hUjPxCzHE0qZF0Gm). This includes launching incentive models and calibrating value flows; establishing operational processes, norms, and shared accountability; and standing up core governance infrastructure to support safe, transparent protocol evolution.

The FF governance team also introduced a broader governance framework built on three interacting pillars, each covering a distinct dimension of Filecoin governance.

As its Operator, FIL-B is reimagining the Orbit Program to foster even greater impact, and that includes introducing new specialized roles designed to recognize diverse contributions and amplify the community's collective reach. Filecoin Foundation remains the Program Owner — guiding strategy, messaging, and funding. 

This year Filecoin Orbit welcomed 10 new regional ambassadors, including university chapters at Northwestern Univeristy, Purdue University, University of Pennsylvnia, and Waterloo, as well as teams in Accra, India, Latin America, Nigeria, Prague, Thailand, and Vietnam. Activating and engaging technical communities through Code n’ Corgi workshops, hackathon support, and Filecoin Onchain Cloud launch initiatives was a key focus for the program as it onboarded the next wave of Filecoin builders. 

### Regulatory and Policy: Protecting the Filecoin Ecosystem

#### Policy by the Numbers

* 312 policymakers engaged with FF to learn about Filecoin

2025 marked one of the most consequential years for digital asset policy in the United States, with unprecedented legislative activity shaping the future of decentralized technologies. Throughout this pivotal period, Filecoin Foundation worked to ensure that the Filecoin ecosystem’s interests were understood and protected. A key milestone was the House passage of the CLARITY Act, legislation that would provide essential regulatory certainty for decentralized storage networks and help create conditions for the Filecoin ecosystem to continue to grow and innovate in the United States.

FF engaged with policymakers around the world to ensure that legislators recognize Filecoin as an important and legitimate use case with many real-world applications. As just one example of this work, FF organized a DePIN fly-in in Washington, D.C. focused on educating policymakers on the unique attributes and benefits of Filecoin and DePIN.

As we head into 2026 and anticipate material progress on market structure legislation in the U.S., FF is focused on ensuring that the language in any bill will be positive for the Filecoin ecosystem, setting the stage for a more favorable regulatory environment in the future.
