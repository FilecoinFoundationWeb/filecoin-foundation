### Introduction 

Last year marked five years since Filecoin mainnet launch, a milestone that underscored both how far the network has come and the growing urgency of our work to build a better, more resilient web. 

In 2025, global [internet outages](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/oct/20/amazon-web-services-aws-outage-hits-dozens-websites-apps) exposed the fragility of centralized cloud providers. The rapid rise of autonomous agents [heightened demand](https://fil.org/blog/ai-agents-and-why-storage-is-the-key-to-smarter-more-reliable-agents) for decentralized infrastructure while [intesifying questions](https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/08/environmental-groups-call-for-halt-to-new-data-center-construction/) around data center efficiency and sustainability. And perhaps most striking, a [massive internet outage](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/18/cloudflare-down-outage-traffic-spike-x-chatgpt.html) occurred on the same day as the Filecoin Onchain Cloud launch –– a powerful reminder that the need for decentralized storage is becoming increasingly clear.

As the Filecoin community looks toward 2026 with renewed energy to meet mounting demand, Filecoin Foundation (FF) seeks to rally the Filecoin ecosystem around [FF’s top-level ecosystem-facing objective](https://fil.org/blog/filecoin-foundation-s-vision-and-strategic-priorities-for-2025): 

**make Filecoin work seamlessly and find product-market fit (PMF)**.

But first, let’s look back at 2025 and celebrate the achievements of Filecoin Foundation and the broader ecosystem –– from major network upgrades and infrastructure improvements to data onboarding partnerships, governance initiatives, and more. 

We’re proud to share our progress and grateful to continue supporting the Filecoin ecosystem throughout 2026.

### What is Filecoin Foundation? 

Filecoin Foundation’s mission is to preserve humanity’s most important information by facilitating the open source governance of the Filecoin network, funding research and development projects related to Filecoin and decentralized technologies, and supporting the growth of the Filecoin ecosystem and community. 

FF’s vision is to create a world in which Filecoin and related decentralized technologies safeguard knowledge , empower users, and embed core civil liberties and human rights — such as free speech and privacy — into the fabric of the world’s technological infrastructure. We want to build a decentralized, efficient, and robust foundation for the future of the Web.

In 2017, the creators of Filecoin envisioned a governance body to serve as a long-term steward for the Filecoin network, modeled after other open source foundations, such as the Mozilla and Linux Foundations. The Filecoin ecosystem is fully decentralized, and that means that FF does not dictate the direction of the Filecoin ecosystem. Rather, FF’s goal is to bring together and empower the Filecoin community, including storage providers, data clients, token holders, developers, and other ecosystem participants. This includes facilitating the Filecoin network’s open source governance process, providing funding to teams building in the ecosystem, hosting events to convene ecosystem participants, and running critical security programs, as well as supporting the Filecoin ecosystem in other ways.

In this report, you’ll read about the ways that Filecoin Foundation supported the Filecoin community in 2025 and learn about FF’s strategic priorities in 2026. FF’s top ecosystem-facing objective in 2026 remains to make Filecoin work seamlessly and find product-market fit. But FF cannot dictate what the Filecoin community should do to pursue these objectives. Instead, FF’s strategic priorities in 2026 are about mobilizing the ecosystem to achieve those goals. This includes driving a process to align the community on the most important actions to make Filecoin work seamlessly and find product-market fit, and supporting projects that will help accomplish those goals.

But before we dive into our plans for 2026, let’s take a look back at the achievements of Filecoin Foundation in 2025. 

### Ecosystem Funding: Supporting the Filecoin Community

#### Ecosystem Support by the Numbers 

* 150+ teams supported through FF funding and grants 
* 386 hackathon submissions for Filecoin-related projects  

Filecoin Foundation supports the growth and innovation of the Filecoin ecosystem by funding research and development projects for decentralized technologies. Through diverse funding mechanisms –– from collaborations and grants to public goods funding and tooling support –– FF ensures that builders, contributors, and researchers have the resources they need to advance the Filecoin network. 

FF also plays an active role in supporting the ecosystem’s Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RetroPGF) program, [introduced](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/unveiling-fil-retropgf-1-retroactively-funding-filecoin-public-goods/) in March 2024 to enhance Filecoin’s economic mechanisms and address funding gaps for high-impact contributions. As an open source protocol, public good funding is an important tool for strengthening shared infrastructure and supporting long-term ecosystem health. FF’s role in retroactive funding helps ensure that impactful projects can continue to operate and expand. 

The second round of RetroPGF concluded [in December 2024](https://medium.com/cryptoeconlab/a-deepdive-into-fil-retropgf-2-results-880234699fe4), allocating 270,000 FIL to 97 projects to recognize critical contributions across storage operations, developer infrastructure, programmable data, retrieval markets, and decentralized consensus. The third round of RetroPGF concluded in December 2025, allocating 500,000 FIL to 91 projects.

#### Commons Data Preservation

Throughout 2025, the QE team worked closely with FF partners, including Harvard Library Innovation Lab, Human Rights Data Analysis Group (HRDAG), Internet Archive, and others, to develop decentralized storage solutions for diverse data preservation communities, driving novel use cases for Filecoin and providing critical product feedback to the ecosystem.

As part of Filecoin Foundation’s mission to preserve humanity’s most important information, the QE team stewards over 3.5 PiB of culturally valuable datasets on the network, including data from [Democracy’s Library,](https://blog.archive.org/2022/10/19/announcing-democracys-library/) [Flickr Commons](https://www.flickr.com/commons), [NASA GEDI geospatial data](https://gedi.umd.edu/), [MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/), [Prelinger Archives](https://help.archive.org/help/prelinger-archive/), and more.

#### Archival Data Onboarding with Singularity

As one of the only open source, self-hosted tools for onboarding data to the network, Singularity is the first choice for archival clients who want full control of their Filecoin pipeline. QE’s commons data preservation work gives the team a tight feedback loop with archival partners, allowing the QE team to dogfood and simplify Singularity as a pathway for onboarding and retrieval of large archival datasets. Through this work, the team has identified critical bugs and usability issues –– not just in Singularity, but across Filecoin’s broader tooling and systems.

### Governance: Shaping a New Era of Filecoin Governance 

#### Governance by the Numbers 

* 3 network upgrades in FY2025
* 13 FIPs and 1 Filecoin Requests for Comments (FRC) executed across upgrades
* 780+ PiB of DataCap distributed  

Governance of the Filecoin ecosystem is at an inflection point.Since the network’s inception, Filecoin’s open source governance has been anchored in the Filecoin Improvement Proposal (FIP) process. As the network has scaled, the demands on governance have expanded as well. This year, FF continued to strengthen the governance framework to meet the needs of a maturing network while staying true to its decentralized, open source principles.

As an open source project, Filecoin is governed through community-driven processes rooted in openness, collaboration, and shared stewardship. FF supports this decentralized model by facilitating transparent [forums for discussion](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs), broadening and diversifying participation, and ensuring that community input meaningfully informs the evolution of the core protocol.
