[Thanks for joining us at FIL Dev Summit!](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/fil-dev-summit-6-toronto-takeaways-and-next-steps/) The sixth edition of FDS in Toronto brought builders, developers, and the Filecoin ecosystem together for two days of collaboration. Focused on decision-making, technical experimentation, and forward-thinking discussions about the future of the network, the in-person summit followed the Virtual FDS Kickoff Sessions, a topic-driven prelude offering a high-level overview of key challenges and opportunities. Together, they created space for everything from technical deep dives to real-time product dogfooding and focused workshops.

[New Avalanche x Filecoin Data Bridge Unlocks Cross-Chain Value.](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/new-avalanche-x-filecoin-data-bridge-unlocks-cross-chain-value/) In a new cross-ecosystem initiative, Filecoin Foundation and Ava Labs are launching a native cross-chain data bridge between Avalanche C-Chain and Filecoin via the Filecoin Virtual Machine (FEVM). This collaboration stacks Avalanche's high-speed, scalable execution with Filecoin’s verifiable data network, laying the groundwork for modular, cross-chain infrastructure that can scale with enterprise demand.

[FIL Euro Tour is here!](/events/fil-euro-summer) From May to July 2025, we’re supporting Filecoin activations across Europe to empower the ecosystem to connect and collaborate. Join us this summer as we connect with local communities across Europe to build the future of decentralized technology. 

## Ecosystem

- Filecoin Foundation helped lead the client success track at FDS-6, focused on the practical challenges and strategies for driving real-world adoption of Filecoin storage, particularly among enterprise clients. Participants explored client-centric growth, Ideal Customer Profiles (ICPs), improved onboarding tools, driving real-world adoption of Filecoin, and laying the groundwork for scalable demand. 
- [Proof of Data Possession (PDP) is live on mainnet.](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/introducing-proof-of-data-possession-pdp-verifiable-hot-storage-on-filecoin) PDP supports verifiable hot storage on the Filecoin network, opening the door to new use cases while preserving integrity and openness - resulting in a more capable network offering both cold storage proofs and hot storage for fast retrievals. 

## Network Operations

### Governance

- Filecoin Foundation led the Governance & Community track at FDS-6, exploring new ways to scale community capability, participation, and alignment through faster decision-making tools, metrics, and an iterative improvement process, capped off by a major milestone with a test of [vote.fil.org](http://vote.fil.org) during the summit. 
- Join the Filecoin governance discussion! To get involved, visit the [Governance GitHub](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs) and join the conversation in the [#fil-gov Slack channel.](https://filecoinproject.slack.com/archives/C0535S9TUUF) These spaces are an open forum for Filecoin community members to come together and discuss important issues and initiatives related to the governance of the Filecoin Network. The FIP pipeline as of June 1, 2025 includes:  
- 7 Discussions in motion
