### **Ecosystem**

* Messari’s[ State of Filecoin Q2 2025 report is out](https://messari.io/report/state-of-filecoin-q2-2025). Read it for a detailed overview of the network, including increased network utilization rates, new daily storage deals rising, PDP launch, and more. 
* **[Join the Filecoin Onchain Cloud Alpha Cohort.](https://app.akindo.io/wave-hacks/1PRjgGzKaTqXaQBBl)** Filecoin Onchain Cloud is a new framework of on-chain and composable cloud services by enabling a growing set of reusable services built on top of the Filecoin storage layer. Its on-chain substrate, Filecoin on-chain payment, warm storage, SLAs, and standardized & CDN retrieval interfaces let any team ship a service with the ease of deploying a smart contract.
* [PL Genesis: Modular Worlds Hackathon winners have been announced](https://x.com/PL__Genesis/status/1946309533900689653)! Thanks for submitting your projects to the “Hack The Sovereign Data Layer with Filecoin” challenge.

### **Network Operations**

***Fil Plus*** 

* New Filecoin Plus allocator pathways have been added. Over the past eight weeks, the Governance Team has received more than 140 applications for DataCap allocator pathways, with 75% approved — resulting in over 450 PiB of DataCap distributed. Most applications are pursuing manual diligence pathways, focusing on both public open and private enterprise datasets. A new meta allocator pathway is also in development to support ecosystem teams building onboarding tools for enterprise clients.
* The[ August 19 Allocator Governance Cal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ECscTHagas)l is available on YouTube. If you would like to attend these meetings live, add the[ Fil+ Allocator Governance calendar.](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=c_k1gkfoom17g0j8c6bam6uf43j0%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FLos_Angeles)
