## Empowering AI through Decentralization and Innovation

Twenty years ago, Web2 ushered in greater interactivity and collaboration on the web. It also gave rise to a few dominant players across the web who centralized control over networks and information online. Today, artificial intelligence (AI) is at risk of following a similar, centralized path. Major AI developers are [locking down their data and code](https://www.vice.com/en/article/5d3naz/openai-is-now-everything-it-promised-not-to-be-corporate-closed-source-and-for-profit), leaving builders and consumers with little visibility into how models function. The integrity of any AI model relies heavily on transparency around how it’s developed, what data it relies on, and how it operates. Yet, the current trend toward centralization and opacity threatens to [erode global trust in AI](https://assets.kpmg.com/content/dam/kpmg/au/pdf/2023/trust-in-ai-global-insights-2023.pdf).

As the AI industry continues to expand, driving an increasing need for data storage and computational power, Web3 tools like Filecoin are uniquely positioned to help decentralize and support AI development. According to a recent [Grayscale Research](https://www.grayscale.com/research/reports/ai-is-coming-crypto-can-help-make-it-right) report on the intersection of crypto and AI, “decentralized AI holds the potential to bring these important decisions out from walled gardens and into public ownership.”

By leveraging Filecoin’s infrastructure, developers and organizations can contribute to AI systems without concentrating power in the hands of a few players. This approach fosters innovation while ensuring that AI development remains open and transparent.

This month, Filecoin Foundation (FF) is launching quarterly updates designed to hone in on different trends across our ecosystem. Our first quarterly update explores how the Filecoin network is enabling a more decentralized, open, and transparent AI-driven industry and highlights key developments and milestones from the Filecoin ecosystem over the past several months.

## Filecoin is Key Infrastructure for Decentralized AI

At a time when tech giants are [investing billions](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/meta-plans-37bn-digital-infrastructure-investment-in-2024/) in [additional storage infrastructure](https://www.cbre.com/insights/reports/global-data-center-trends-2024) to account for [growing market demand](https://www.statista.com/outlook/tmo/data-center/storage/worldwide#revenue), the Filecoin network is designed to scale, built to accommodate storage in the petabyte or even exbibyte level — that’s more than one [quadrillion pages of plain-text type](<https://www.techtarget.com/searchstorage/definition/exbibyte-EiB#:~:text=An%20exbibyte%20(EiB)%20is%20a,260%20or%201,152,921,504,606,846,976%20bytes>).

Filecoin offers other benefits for AI networks, too, including:

- **Immutability and Proof of Storage:** A key advantage of Filecoin’s crypto-powered storage network is its built-in immutability, which provides a tamper-proof record or data provenance and usage. For AI, this ensures that records, datasets, or computations stored on the Filecoin network maintain a transparent history, supporting the development of trustworthy and transparent AI systems.
- **Transparency, Provenance, and Authentication:** An open and robust record of AI data provenance and lineage, and assurance that data has not been tampered with, combats bias and promotes audibility and trust.
- **Resilience:** Decentralized storage technologies like Filecoin rely on a robust network of storage providers around the globe to store multiple copies of data, rather than large corporations susceptible to single points of failure.
- **Customization and Flexibility:** Organizations have control over how and where their data is stored, which can be tailored to meet specific compliance and performance needs.

#### Introducing Metropolis (now Fil Poll)

FF [debuted Metropolis](/blog/empowering-governance-the-launch-of-metropolis-to-the-filecoin-community), a temperature check and crowdsource polling tool to enhance the network governance process, built in collaboration with Canvas Technologies. Metropolis was created as a fork of the open-source Pol.is tool, which has been used to support digital democracy efforts in countries around the world. With Metropolis, community members can more easily share their opinions on Filecoin Improvement Proposals (FIPs) by signaling their overall feelings toward the proposal, using “positive” or “negative” descriptors. The goal is to provide temperature checks to give FIP authors and Core Devs an earlier indication of overall community preference for certain proposals, which will help governance steward resources as needed for proposals and ideas.
