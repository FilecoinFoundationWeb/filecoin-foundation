Scalability, diligence, and user experience are at the heart of the Filecoin Plus program priorities in 2025. 

Last November at the [FIL Dev Summit (FDS)](https://www.fildev.io/FDS-5) in Bangkok, teams from around the world gathered to share their input on 2025 goals for Filecoin Plus. Here, the Filecoin Plus team –– made up of Filecoin Foundation’s Filecoin Plus team and Filecoin Incentive Design Labs (FIDL) ––  heard a call from the community for more clarity on the roadmap and evolution of the program. In response, Will Scott, CTO of FIDL, published his perspective on where he expects the program to go. You can [share feedback or join the discussion](https://github.com/filecoin-project/Allocator-Governance/discussions/261) on GitHub.

In this post, we dive deeper into the discussions around Filecoin Plus at FIL Dev Summit and offer an overview and 2025 roadmap for the program. 

## Fil+ at FDS

Alignment around our vision for the next quarter emerged as a central theme at FDS. The focus was on three core priorities:

1. Scalability: Ensuring that the platform can handle growing user demand without compromising performance.
2. Diligence: Continually improving safeguards to ensure that DataCap is used for intended purposes. 
3. User Experience: Making Filecoin adoption seamless for both experienced Allocators and data preparers as well as newcomers alike.

## The Fil+ Roadmap

The FDS discussions served as a touchpoint to receive community feedback and shape priorities for the Filecoin Plus program in 2025. Filecoin Foundation’s governance team, alongside the Filecoin Incentive Design Lab, identified six key action items to pursue this year:

### 1. Layer 2 Scaling Solutions

- Develop and prototype tools for archival and warm storage capabilities.
- Conduct performance benchmarking to ensure seamless transaction processing.

### 2. Security Improvements

- Expand the scope of the bug bounty program and promote it to attract top security researchers.
- Schedule and complete third-party audits for all upcoming smart contracts.

### 3. Onboarding Flow

- Implement usability testing for the new onboarding process.
- Integrate feedback from the mockups into the design and test user satisfaction metrics.

### 4. Filecoin Plus Enhancements

- Design and experiment with temporary programs for new allocation models.
- Explore mechanisms to foster “real deals” while mitigating “self-dealing.”

### 5. Allocator System Experimentation

- Propose new allocator models to address diverse client needs, including non-KYC pathways.
- Evaluate performance of allocator systems in meeting demand for DataCap distribution.

### 6. Layered Incentivization

- Investigate the feasibility of assigning varying levels of subsidy based on data types (e.g., archival, warm storage).
- Assess technical and economic implications of implementing a tiered incentive system.

As we continue to build on these conversations and seek community input, the Filecoin Plus team will publish regular updates about the program’s roadmap and evolution. 

We’re energized to deliver on our commitments to create a platform that empowers users around the globe, with a Filecoin Plus program that continues to evolve and expand support for innovative use cases. And we welcome you to join the discussion. We invite you to attend the [biweekly Allocator meetings](https://lu.ma/filecoin) to connect, share updates, and [collaborate on the program](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLp3zrT1ewY0kYN1hJpERMUxTCbFC4yZwN&feature=shared). and join us this May for the Fil Plus track at [FDS-6: Toronto](https://www.fildev.io/FDS-6).  

## About Fil+

Filecoin Foundation facilitates the Filecoin Plus (Fil+) program, which aims to increase the amount of useful data stored on the Filecoin network. 

Allocators play a key role in the Filecoin Plus program by verifying and onboarding real client data to the Filecoin network. Their primary responsibility is distributing DataCap to clients.

DataCap is a network resource used in deals to incentivize Filecoin storage actors that are facilitating value-additive activities to the network, such as providing hardware capacity, providing data storage, or providing retrieval of stored data. Clients can use DataCap to pay storage providers as part of a storage deal, which increases a storage provider’s probability of earning block rewards. 

Clients can request DataCap from allocators, each of whom has their own application process. FF recently added an allocator registry to the [Filecoin Plus web page](/filecoin-plus/allocators) to help data clients connect with prospective allocators.
