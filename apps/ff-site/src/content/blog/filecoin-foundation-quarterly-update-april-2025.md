## How Filecoin is Shaping the Future of AI 

As the AI industry rapidly expands –– now valued at $9 trillion according to the 2024 [State of AI Report](https://www.stateof.ai/) –– Filecoin’s decentralized storage network offers an open source alternative for data storage. Yet, today’s internet landscape is dominated by centralization, with a handful of corporations controlling the majority of global cloud data. This concentration of power [leaves the web fragile](/blog/the-web-isn-t-forever-new-research-findings-from-not-your-parents-web-project), exposing information to single points of failure prone to outages, blackouts, and takedowns. 

The challenges of centralization extend to AI agents –– autonomous systems reshaping how we engage with technology. While designed to make independent decisions based on large-scale datasets and continuously evolve through new interactions, most AI systems today operate within opaque, [centralized infrastructures](https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2024/05/the-scramble-for-ai-computing-power/). AI training data is often proprietary and inaccessible, making it difficult to verify how models consume information in their reasoning process to generate insights — fundamentally limiting AI’s transparency, verifiability, and innovative potential.

The Filecoin network is uniquely positioned to address these challenges by enabling decentralization and transparency. Key advantages include: 

- Creating an auditable and tamper-proof way for AI projects to verify their models, datasets, and computations;
- Offering a compelling alternative to these centralized models through decentralized, transparent data storage; and
- Fostering trust while reinforcing the resilience of our digital infrastructure. 

In this quarterly update, we will spotlight how the Filecoin network is forming the backbone for not only a better version of the web, but a better foundation for emerging technologies like AI. 

## AI Agents Leveraging Filecoin’s Infrastructure

Data storage is what powers the internet to function and underpins the credibility and integrity of AI systems. Several AI agent projects are already incorporating Filecoin’s decentralized storage: 

[Recall](https://recall.network/) is building a reputation system for AI agents to ensure they operate on high-integrity, verifiable data. As a foundational intelligence layer, Recall enables agents to prove, monetize, and exchange knowledge in a decentralized, trustless way. Beyond verification, Recall serves as a multi-agent marketplace, allowing AI agents to trade knowledge and skills, reduce redundancy, and accelerate collective intelligence. Imagine a meal planning agent that could source dietary adjustments from a diabetes management agent, ensuring customized recommendations. Built as an [Interplanetary Consensus](https://github.com/consensus-shipyard) (IPC) subnet, Recall plans to store agent data on Filecoin.

[Theoriq](https://mirror.xyz/0xbCAa90C8bA95b3ba6C8Aa6900a92FE70b97E5eF7/y8zj9hbr6ZEES9V9bMtqyzEBm0osh5ivoSBEYVN3mkI) is a protocol that facilitates the coordination of and communication between AI agents. Theoriq and Filecoin Foundation are working to develop a series of AI agents trained on data from the Filecoin network, making open data more accessible and usable to developers and researchers. A [Filecoin AI agent](https://infinity.theoriq.ai/) trained on the Filecoin docs and GitHub repositories allows users to get answers through natural language queries on how to build on Filecoin, troubleshoot common issues, get started as a storage provider, and more.

[Ungate AI](https://x.com/ungateai?lang=en) is a platform that facilitates AI agent-to-agent communication, leveraging Filecoin and Eigenlayer to build a trust layer for AI in order to avoid hidden human override or external manipulation occurring without detection. Ungate [relies on](https://x.com/UngateAI/status/1899802770821226549) Filecoin’s decentralized storage to store metadata, ensuring AI agent execution proofs are immutably recorded and permanently accessible.

[AIWS](/ecosystem-explorer/aiws) is creating a modular network for generating and managing autonomous AI agents fully integrated with decentralized storage and compute stacks. All AI agent metadata, prompts, and data are preserved on Filecoin.

As AI becomes increasingly embedded in daily life, the demand for personal agency over AI systems will grow exponentially. Users — both individuals and organizations — will seek AI agents that align with their specific needs while respecting data sovereignty.

## Building the Next Generation of AI Systems

For developers building the next generation of AI agents, Filecoin's infrastructure offers a critical competitive advantage. In a market where users are increasingly [concerned](https://www.axios.com/2025/02/13/trust-ai-china-us) about data privacy and trustworthiness, systems built on verifiable foundations will command premium positioning.

Filecoin builders are shaping the future of AI and other emerging technologies at in-person workshops like [Code N' Corgi](https://x.com/FilFoundation/status/1892612390199374097), a developer-driven series designed for builders in the Filecoin ecosystem, and through various [hackathons](https://www.encode.club/ai-blueprints). By providing essential infrastructure for building AI that's not just smart but transparent, accountable, and trustworthy, too, Filecoin is establishing the foundation for AI systems that will truly thrive in the long term.
