**On stage at FIL Bangkok, teams unveiled new L2 data storage solutions,** signaling a new era of what’s possible with Filecoin by extending the network's capabilities. [Akave](/ecosystem-explorer/akave), a decentralized, modular L2 solution offering cutting-edge encryption, announced the launch of its Yucca testnet. Storacha, a high-performance decentralized storage solution built with Filecoin, launched its closed alpha network tailored for gaming, AI, and DePIN networks. [Read more about the latest L2 announcements](/blog/filecoin-ecosystem-teams-unveil-l2s) on our blog.

**The Filecoin community convened at FIL Dev Summit 5, sponsored by FF.** Filecoin developers, builders, storage providers, and ecosystem members came together as a community to contribute to the exciting trajectory of the Filecoin network. FF’s Clara Tsao led a track on Product Market Fit, and Meghan Gavis ran a track on Web3 marketing. Other FF presenters included Paul Wagner, on Service Classes and SLOs, Filipa Ribeiro on UX pitfalls, and Stef Magdalinski and Danny O’Brien on dogfooding – [Watch the full recap](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_0VrY55uV1__uv3uOvZ3L6exG9y10lSy).

**Filecoin Recognized by Fast Company.** In its fourth annual [Next Big Things in Tech](https://www.fastcompany.com/next-big-things-in-tech/list) list, Fast Company featured the Filecoin Network, honoring emerging technology that has a profound impact on industries—from education and sustainability to robotics and artificial intelligence. As the AI industry rapidly expands – now valued at $9 trillion according to the latest [State of AI Report](https://www.stateof.ai/) – Filecoin’s decentralized storage network offers an open-source alternative for data storage.

## Ecosystem

- Introducing Next Step Builder Grants. Filecoin Foundation is working with FIL-B to provide $5k to $10k support for builders taking their Filecoin projects to the next level! Focus areas include developer and data tooling, integrations, storage, retrieval, technical content creation, and FVM. [Learn more about Builder Grants](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/blob/master/Program%20Resources/Builder%20Next%20Step%20Grants.md).
- Get ready for Fast Finality in Filecoin (F3), the biggest network upgrade since FVM. F3 is coming to the network in Q1 of 2025, speeding up finality on the network by 450X. With F3, finalization times are reduced from 7.5 hours (900 epochs) to just minutes, improving user experience and opening the door for applications, exchanges, and interoperability to build on the network. [Read more about how F3 is revolutionizing Filecoin](/blog/how-f3-is-transforming-the-filecoin-network)!
- FF's Storage and Community team supported several tracks at FDS-5 to help share business strategies on how to drive demand, create additional revenue streams for storage providers, and solidify Filecoin's market positioning, including:
  - [The Product Market Fit (PMF) Strategies track at FDS-5](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_0VrY55uV1_1_yjpG2JWf9M0evZPpUsR), where participants dove into Filecoin’s value proposition and how it can align with market needs.
  - **The APAC Community Roundtable**, a session focused on the APAC community featuring a Q&A on key network updates, sharing insights, and charting the Filecoin ecosystem's growth in Asia.
  - [Service Provider Growth & Enablement](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_0VrY55uV18rTa-VHr42DVTd0I23AhOL), a track where storage and service providers in the Filecoin ecosystem came together to explore strategies for overcoming challenges in their businesses, unlocking growth, and generating revenue.

## Network Ops

### Governance

- The NV24 upgrade introduced crucial improvements in network security, performance, and developer functionality, continuing Filecoin's mission to provide a robust and decentralized storage solution to preserve humanity's most important information. Three FIPs were in scope, including:
  - [FIP-0081: Introduce Lower Bound for Sector Initial Pledge.](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0081.md) A critical enhancement comes with improvements to the sector initial pledge mechanism, ensuring that the network maintains sufficient collateral to secure consensus, even as storage growth fluctuates.
  - [FIP-0094: Add Support for EIP-5656 in the FEVM](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0094.md). The upgrade includes performance boosts for smart contracts running on the Filecoin Ethereum Virtual Machine (FEVM). By adding support for modern memory operations and historical randomness, developers can now create more efficient and secure applications on the Filecoin network.
  - [FIP-0095: Add FEVM Precompile to Fetch Beacon Digest from Chain History.](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0095.md) FIP-0095 enhances the FEVM by enabling smart contracts to access randomness from prior chain epochs through a newly added precompile.

### Fil Plus

- The Fil+ team supported the [Fil+ track at FDS-5](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_0VrY55uV1-S6B8I9GBRhb_Y5BM1NFQA), highlighting recent program updates, tooling developments, and key topics with Allocators, including:
  - [The State of Fil+](https://youtu.be/PlSz47MvZ1Q), which provided an overview of the latest metrics and tooling status.
  - **Macroeconomics**, which discussed the macroeconomic factors affecting the flow of datacap in the Fil+ ecosystem and strategies to balance community needs with effective enforcement of economic policies.
