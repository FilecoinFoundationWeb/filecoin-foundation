[Filecoin Foundation Teams up with [Aethir](/ecosystem-explorer/aethir). Announced at FIL Singapore, Aethir (decentralized GPU cloud computing) and FF are collaborating to address GPU scarcity and enhance AI-driven data security. Aethir announced support for the Filecoin network, offering advanced GPU leasing capabilities to improve data processing and storage efficiency.

[The Filecoin Ecosystem Digest: All Systems Go](/digest) is live! The inaugural issue explores topics that impact the ecosystem –– from interplanetary resilience to AI-generated media and sustainable data centers. The Digest highlights the voices behind the technology being developed in the Filecoin network –– as we embark on a collective journey towards a decentralized future.

[DocumentCloud is now using Filecoin to ensure long-term preservation and distribution of documents](https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2024/sep/11/featured-add-on-push-to-ipfs-filecoin/). DocumentCloud is a platform used by newsrooms worldwide that hosts over 11+ million key public interest documents, including declassified CIA records. With support from [Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web](https://ffdweb.org/blog/ffdw-and-muckrock-collaborate-to-bring-flagship-web-resource-to-the-decentralized-web/), DocumentCloud is leveraging the Filecoin network to preserve these documents and protect them from increasingly serious threats to public access.

- The Devrel team added [SP Deal Renewal 101 documentation](https://github.com/filecoin-project/filecoin-docs/pull/2304).
