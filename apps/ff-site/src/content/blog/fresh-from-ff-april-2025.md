[Why Storage is the Key to Smarter, More Reliable AI Agents. ](https://fil.org/blog/ai-agents-and-why-storage-is-the-key-to-smarter-more-reliable-agents)Today, AI's reliance on centralized infrastructure not only limits transparency and user control but also introduces systemic risks related to data access, security, and verifiability - challenges that decentralized approaches can help address. By leveraging decentralized storage networks like Filecoin that provide data verifiability and cryptographic proofs, agent builders can create AI systems that are more resilient, transparent, and scalable than their centralized counterparts. 

[Decentralize Your Data. Store It with Filecoin. ](https://fil.org/blog/decentralize-your-data-store-it-with-filecoin)The future of storage isn’t just about where data lives –– it’s also about who controls it. Filecoin puts that power back in your hands. Combining blockchain technology with decentralized storage offers a fundamentally different approach to data storage. By distributing data across a decentralized, global network, Filecoin creates a foundation for a more open, resilient, and user-controlled digital future.

[Ungate integrates Filecoin to enhance security, scalability, and reliability](https://x.com/UngateAI/status/1899802770821226549). Ungate Wukong – the Autonomous Verification Stack (AVS) for AI agents – is changing how autonomous agents operate through cryptographically verifiable and transparent actions. Ungate has integrated Filecoin via [Lighthouse](https://www.lighthouse.storage/), a platform built with Filecoin offering perpetual storage, to archive AI-generated proofs on decentralized storage. 

## Ecosystem 

* [Nineteen attendees joined the March Developer Working Group Call.](https://youtu.be/eECF67TZLe8?feature=shared) The Filecoin Developer Working Group is a space to connect with developers, community members, researchers, and others interested in the development of new tools, technologies, and use cases that leverage the Filecoin protocol.

## Network Operations

### Governance

* The Network version 25 "Teep" upgrade is scheduled to land on mainnet April 11. The upgrade introduces improvements that make Filecoin more efficient and adaptable, simplifying storage provider economics and enhancing developer tooling. Overall these changes make the network more flexible, adaptable, and dynamic for builders, storage providers, and storage clients alike. 

### Fil Plus

* Read the latest community proposal:[ an Experimental Pathway Metaallocator (EPMA)](https://github.com/filecoin-project/Allocator-Governance/issues/313). This proposal introduces 1PiB of testable DataCap within the Filecoin Plus (Fil+) program, designed for allocators that seek to experiment with novel approaches to making DataCap allocations. For information on how to apply to develop a pathway, [read the Filecoin Incentive Design Lab (FIDL) blog](https://blog.allocator.tech/2024/05/rolling-applications-are-open-for.html). 
* Organizations wishing to apply to become Allocators are encouraged to [review the proposal for changes to the Application form](https://github.com/filecoin-project/Allocator-Governance/discussions/305). This form will be collected by new and existing Allocator pathways to ensure the data onboarded is within guidelines of compliance.
* A thorough diligence audit was completed by 17 allocator organizations to ensure their onboarding of client data maintains retrieval and storage standards. 

## Marketing, Comms, & Events

* New for FIL Dev Summit Toronto: Introducing [Virtual Kickoff Sessions](https://lu.ma/ry15g7r5?tk=YqBU2g). Happening April 23-30 before the in-person gathering in Toronto May 12-13. Why join the Virtual Sessions? They are a great opportunity for collaboration, and a chance to get up to speed ahead of the on-site summit. Sessions will cover:
* April 23 - The Filecoin State of the Union: Navigating Growth & Market Shifts
* April 24 - Storage Adoption: Winning Clients, Scaling Demand, and Lessons from the Field
* April 25 - The On-Chain Tech Stack: Unlocking Filecoin’s Smart Data Economy
* April 28 - Tools & Builders: Supercharging Innovation in the Filecoin Ecosystem
* April 29 - Value Accrual & Funding: The Path to Sustainable Growth
* April 30 - Governance & Community: Strengthening the Filecoin Network from Within
* Watch the [newest episode of DWeb Decoded featuring the U.S. CFTC’s Kristin Johnson](https://youtu.be/LJO3PmzYUkI). This special episode recorded live from Davos, and hosted by Filecoin Foundation President Marta Belcher, explores the evolving regulatory landscape for cybersecurity, AI, and blockchain.
