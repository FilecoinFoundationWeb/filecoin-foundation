**On November 18, 2025, the Filecoin ecosystem introduced Filecoin Onchain Cloud at DePIN Day Buenos Aires.** Filecoin Onchain Cloud is a decentralized, onchain layer that provides verifiable storage, retrieval, and payments. Built on the world’s largest decentralized storage network, Filecoin Onchain Cloud exposes core cloud functions into programmable, verifiable services that allows developers to build directly on infrastructure that proves where data lives, how it’s accessed, and when it’s paid for. **[Read more](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/filecoin-onchain-cloud-launch-roundup/).**

**FIL Dev Summit 7 brought builders, researchers, and ecosystem leaders in Buenos Aires to chart the network's path forward.** The Filecoin community came together in person to build on the discussions from its [virtual, online-only companion event in October](https://fil.org/events/virtual-fil-dev-summit-7), tackle technical challenges, and facilitate cross-team coordination to drive the network's next phase of evolution. Get the recap. 

## Ecosystem

- Filecoin Onchain Cloud is live on testnet, with mainnet support expected in early 2026. Over [100 early builders](https://app.akindo.io/wave-hacks/1PRjgGzKaTqXaQBBl?tab=overview) have been experimenting with Filecoin Onchain Cloud for the last three months, building new dApps, tools, and communities with onchain, verifiable storage and services. Demos, workshops, and developer walkthroughs are [available on YouTube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_0VrY55uV181dWs7RfIpx0ZAUZeNMjE1&si=PxWegrh7jcexyrXB), where developers can l build applications with onchain control over data, payments, and logic on [filecoin.cloud](http://filecoin.cloud).
- [Introducing Synapse SDK](https://docs.filecoin.cloud/getting-started). Filecoin Synapse SDKis a simple, easy-to-use Javascript SDK for builders to access Filecoin Onchain Cloud flagship services to power new dApps and smart contracts.It lets developers upload, retrieve, and pay for storage using simple, high-level APIs. 
- Messari’s State of [Filecoin Q3 2025](https://messari.io/report/state-of-filecoin-q3-2025) was released on November 13. Read it for a detailed overview of the network, including increased network utilization rates, new daily storage deals rising, PDP launch, and more.

## Network Operations

- On November 6, FF’s governance team launched the [Constellation Program](https://fil.org/blog/help-us-shape-a-new-era-of-filecoin-governance), a structured, community-driven initiative exploring improvements to Filecoin governance. Constellation is a deliberate, iterative process to be designed, tested, and aligned with the needs of the ecosystem. At FDS-7, the governance team shared progress reports on the program focused on strengthening participation and decision-making across the ecosystem.
- Earlier this year, [FIP-0100](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0100.md) was passed, introducing key updates designed to strengthen Filecoin’s economic model and network stability. To monitor its implementation and impact, a dedicated committee was established to discuss the key metrics it is tracking.
