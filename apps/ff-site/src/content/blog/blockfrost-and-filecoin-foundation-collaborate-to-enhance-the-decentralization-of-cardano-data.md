Blockfrost and Filecoin Foundation (FF) are collaborating to integrate Filecoin’s decentralized storage capabilities as a robust backup layer for Cardano apps built with Blockfrost. This collaboration will enhance the data redundancy, quality assurance, and decentralization of Cardano apps.

Blockfrost provides an API-as-a-service solution that simplifies access to the Cardano blockchain, offering additional features without the need to run or maintain complex infrastructure and tooling. Blockfrost also runs InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) Gateway clusters, enabling users to add, pin, and access resources.

By archiving its IPFS Gateway clusters on Filecoin, the world’s largest decentralized storage network, Blockfrost will introduce a new service tier for Cardano builders that includes both IPFS and Filecoin storage. This integration not only strengthens the resilience of future Cardano apps but also highlights a commitment to decentralization by prioritizing the coordination of two leading layer-1 blockchain ecosystems: Cardano and Filecoin.

The benefits of the collaboration include:

- **Data Redundancy:** By storing Blockfrost’s IPFS node cluster on Filecoin, developers building on Cardano gain enhanced data redundancy and resilience, ensuring critical data is securely stored across a distributed network and protected against loss, corruption, or manipulation.
- **Quality Assurance:** Blockfrost’s new service tier, which offers decentralized storage via Filecoin, gives developers the choice to securely store their data on Filecoin while ensuring scalable, seamless access. By extending storage capabilities and adding a premium backup layer, Blockfrost gives developers more tools to build reliable, data-driven applications.
- **Data Verifiability:** The integration of Filecoin provides secure data provenance with immutable storage, transparent onchain verifiability, and cryptographic hashing. Leveraging Proof of Replication, Filecoin ensures data is uniquely stored, while Proof of Spacetime validates continuous storage over time. These essential features enable the creation of tamper-proof, auditable datasets, paving the way to deploying trustworthy AI applications with Blockfrost and empowering reliable, decentralized model training.
- **Commitment to Decentralization:** Both Blockfrost and the Filecoin Foundation share a commitment to decentralizing the internet. Securing Cardano applications’ onchain data on Filecoin enables developers to build on a truly decentralized, redundant, and resilient storage infrastructure.

“Blockfrost is setting a new standard for data reliability and durability in Cardano’s ecosystem with Filecoin,” said Marek Mahut, CEO, Blockfrost. “This integration can give developers peace of mind, knowing that their applications benefit from Filecoin’s decentralized storage and redundancy features.”

“Bringing Filecoin’s decentralized storage to the Cardano ecosystem helps developers create apps that are more secure, reliable, and future-proof,” said Clara Tsao, a founding officer at Filecoin Foundation. “It’s a great example of two leading blockchains converging to support a more resilient and decentralized internet.”

## A More Resilient, Decentralized Future

Blockfrost has integrated with Filecoin via [Lighthouse](/ecosystem-explorer/lighthouse), a platform built on Filecoin offering perpetual storage, encryption, custom gateways, and multi-chain smart contracts. But this collaboration is more than just a technical integration—it’s a move toward a more resilient and decentralized future for Cardano apps. By empowering Cardano developers with new capabilities and leveraging Filecoin’s robust infrastructure, this collaboration enhances data quality assurance, scalability, and redundancy across the Cardano ecosystem.

This collaboration underscores the coordinated efforts of two legacy layer-1 blockchains and marks a step toward making decentralization the standard for the next generation of blockchain applications.

### About Filecoin

Filecoin is a peer-to-peer network to store files, with built-in economic incentives to ensure files are stored reliably over time. It’s designed to create a decentralized, efficient, and robust foundation for humanity’s information.

### About Filecoin Foundation

Filecoin Foundation's mission is to preserve humanity's most important information, as well as to facilitate the open source governance of the Filecoin network, fund research and development projects for decentralized technologies, and support the growth of the Filecoin ecosystem and community.

### About Blockfrost

The Blockfrost API was launched in 2020 with the aim to simplify how developers interact with the Cardano Blockchain. Now, anyone can interact directly with the blockchain, the ecosystem and IPFS without the need to run their own dedicated node, all while maintaining speed and scalability.
