## Day 3: The Onchain Tech Stack: Unlocking Filecoin’s Smart Data Economy

With Day 3 came a highly technical, builder-focused dive into Filecoin’s onchain infrastructure and the frameworks powering verifiable, programmable services. The spotlight was on the Filecoin Web Services (FWS) framework, PDP, stablecoin payments, and composable cloud primitives.

### Key Takeaways

- Presenters explained how FWS aims to create a modular service registry for storage, compute, access control, and more — all governed by onchain Service Level Agreements (SLA) and smart contracts.
- PDP was highlighted as Filecoin’s new hot storage proof, enabling verifiable proofs and real-time data access.
- Devs showcased dApps that integrate storage, PDP, and stablecoin payments through programmable SLAs.
- Viewers got a look at new details for verifiable retrieval, which includes SP reputation scores, payment systems, and decentralized CDN services.
- Tooling teams such as Curio, Lighthouse, and Eastore revealed advances in user experience, access control, and secure data preparation.
- Presenters issued an invitation for a small, select group of SPs to participate in the [PDP SPX Program](https://filoznotebook.notion.site/SPX-Program-PDP-Edition-1e6dc41950c180bc89f6fc252e7e036d) to short-term initiative to test, validate, and showcase PDP in action - a key building block of retrieval-aware storage.

## Day 4: Tools & Builders: Supercharging Innovation in the Filecoin Ecosystem

Day 4 focused on empowering developers with the latest capabilities and community support initiatives driving builder momentum across the Filecoin ecosystem. Sessions outlined recent milestones in protocol development, UX tooling, and grassroots education.

### Key Takeaways

- Sessions on builder enablement showcased new developer primitives like FWS, PDP, and F3 APIs — tools that simplify workflows and expand what’s possible on Filecoin.
- Benchmarking tests across node implementations revealed key performance tradeoffs and offered guidance toward faster, leaner builds.
- Community programs such as Hacker Houses, Orbit Ambassador bootcamps, and regional meetups are accelerating onboarding through immersive, hands-on formats.
- The Filecoin AI Hackathon, run with Encode, attracted more than 80 global submissions at the intersection of decentralized data and AI.
- Updates to the [FIL Frame dApp Starter Kit](https://github.com/FIL-Builders/fil-frame) introduced new modules and integrations that simplify full-stack app development.
