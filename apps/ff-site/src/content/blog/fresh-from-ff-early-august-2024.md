## Ecosystem

### Builders Funnel

Due to popular demand, the [Developer Working Group](https://github.com/filecoin-project/DeveloperWG) will begin meeting monthly. The DevWG is an opportunity for developers, community members, researchers, and others interested in the development of the Filecoin protocol to come together to discuss the most important topics among developers. Join the [#dev-wg](https://filecoinproject.slack.com/archives/C06G5K8H3J7) Slack channel to get the latest news on the meetups.

- Thanks for joining us at the [ETHGlobal Brussels hackathon](https://ethglobal.com/events/brussels/prizes#filecoin)! The Filecoin track received 35 submissions across all three categories: AI tools, data apps, and privacy tools. Visit [hackathons.filecoin.io](http://hackathons.filecoin.io/) to join an upcoming hackathon and help shape the future of the web.

### Storage

- Interested in the latest developments for Filecoin Storage Providers? Join the [#global-storage-provider-community](https://filecoin.io/slack) Slack channel to get involved in weekly SP discussions and stay informed on updates from across the Filecoin community.
- Head of Community Porter Stowell joined the [Off-Chain Podcast](https://youtu.be/YCXgEG0Pva8?si=5bYkc2gIn2JhK0_U) to discuss some of the hottest topics in the ecosystem, including how Filecoin is tackling the ever-growing demand for data storage driven by AI advancements.

## Network Operations

### Governance

- Join the community [governance conversation](/governance)! In the Filecoin ecosystem, governance refers to the rights, rules, processes, and norms that empower community members to collectively determine the development of the protocol. Anyone is welcome to participate through the monthly [Community Governance calls](https://lu.ma/filecoin), the [Fil-Gov Slack](https://filecoin.io/slack) channel, [Metropolis (now Fil Poll)](/blog/empowering-governance-the-launch-of-metropolis-to-the-filecoin-community), or attending a [Filecoin event](/events).
- [FIP0086: Fast Finality in Filecoin](https://x.com/fil_gov/status/1816907389200924988) is now in Last Call. This FIP proposes to significantly speed up the time it takes for Filecoin transactions to be considered final and irreversible, reducing transaction times from 7.5 hours to just a few seconds.

### Fil Plus

- Rolling allocator applications are open for submissions. Allocators are a core part of the Fil+ program and help incentivize the storage of useful data on the Filecoin network. Visit the [FIDL blog](https://blog.allocator.tech/2024/05/rolling-applications-are-open-for.html) for application instructions and a walkthrough.
- [The Fil+ page](/filecoin-plus) is live on fil.org. Learn about the purpose of Fil+ and how to become an allocator, and explore DataCap projects within the program.
- The FIL Plus team is conducting audits on the initial 5 Pib of DataCap distribution as part of the ongoing DataCap refresh. These allocators will either receive a full, partial, or no DataCap refresh.

## Comms, Marketing, & Events

- Franklin Templeton's report _[The Next Frontier in Cloud Computing](https://www.franklintempleton.com/articles/2024/digital-assets/cloud-computing)_ highlights Filecoin as a leading DePIN protocol and powerful alternative to centralized cloud providers. The report presents Filecoin as a network economy with the potential to disrupt centralized infrastructure monopolies.
- Watch "[How Basin Enhances Long- and Short-term Archival with Marla Natoli](https://youtu.be/NSNEZKK0P3E?feature=shared)" on DWeb Decoded to learn more about Basin, a decentralized object storage solution that provides both hot data storage and long-term archiving capabilities.
- Missing Brussels? [Check out the playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLp3zrT1ewY0novXWnDnDvlgyRdBTOevsL&feature=shared)! All Network Base sessions are now available on Filecoin Foundation's YouTube. Subscribe for recaps of governance meetings, event programming, new DWeb Decoded episodes, and more.
- Grayscale’s latest research report featured Filecoin as key infrastructure for decentralized AI. According to their new report: “Grayscale Research believes that decentralized AI holds the potential to bring these important decisions out from walled gardens and into public ownership.” Grayscale’s research includes Al services (chatbots, image generators), solutions to centralized Al problems (authenticity checks, fighting deepfakes), and infrastructure for Al development (data storage, GPU computation). Filecoin provides the decentralized storage solutions crucial for decentralized AI's growth, ensuring data can be securely and transparently managed.
