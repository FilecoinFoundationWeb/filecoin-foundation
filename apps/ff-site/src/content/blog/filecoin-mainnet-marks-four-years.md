This month on October 15, we’re thrilled to celebrate the anniversary of Filecoin’s Mainnet launch! Over the past four years, the Filecoin network has grown tremendously, becoming the world’s largest decentralized storage network.

Today, we say a huge thank you to the incredible Filecoin community of builders, storage providers, data clients, and all those who are helping shape the future of the web.

To catch up on the biggest developments taking place across this growing ecosystem, Filecoin Foundation is launching a [Quarterly Update](/blog/filecoin-foundation-quarterly-update-october-2024) for insights into the latest trends, network developments, and much more.

Let’s take a look at the highlights from the past year and check out what’s in store for the year ahead:

## Sending InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) Into Space

In January, Filecoin Foundation announced a successful first-of-its-kind mission, deploying the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) in space. This mission sent files from Earth to orbit and back using an IPFS implementation designed for space communications. This mission demonstrates the power of using decentralized technology for communications and networking in space. [Dive deeper](https://youtu.be/97NY-5MtjmI) into how decentralized technologies can support communications infrastructure for the emerging space economy with Marta Belcher, President of Filecoin Foundation; Sara Sabry, CEO & Founder of Deep Space Initiative; and Tim Shephard, Vice President of Enterprise Strategy at Lockheed Martin Space.

> Today’s centralized Internet model doesn’t work in space. On today’s Internet, every time you click something, that data has to be retrieved from a centralized server; if you’re on the Moon, there will be a multi-second delay with every click, as content is retrieved from Earth. Using IPFS, data does not need to go back and forth from Earth with every click; instead, when you put in an IPFS ‘content ID,’ that content is retrieved from wherever is closest, rather than being retrieved from a particular server in a particular place. That means if someone else nearby on the Moon has already retrieved that data, the data only has to travel a short distance and can get to you quickly instead of traveling back and forth from Earth with every click. — Marta Belcher, President and Chair of Filecoin Foundation

## Storing Solana’s Block History Onchain

Filecoin's ZK Storage is securing the entire Solana ledger, making all of Solana's history accessible, content addressable, and available. This collaboration helps ensure resiliency, scalability, and enhanced security for Solana, in addition to how Solana builders already benefit from Filecoin for decentralized object storage –– powering SOL websites, NFTs, and the Solana ledger.

## Bringing Novel Layer-2 Solutions to the Network

In the past year, an influx of new L2 solutions launched on the network, enabling a broad array of use cases and applications. [Basin](https://blog.textile.io/basin-launch-overview) and [Akave](/ecosystem-explorer/akave) are leveraging Filecoin’s infrastructure to provide data management and AI-related services, while [Storacha](/ecosystem-explorer/storacha-network) launched a scalable hot storage solution. Hot storage is essential for applications that require their data to be accessed quickly and frequently. The growing number of L2s and protocols built atop Filecoin and IPFS demonstrate that the network is well-positioned to support a wide range of use cases.

## Transforming the Filecoin Network with F3

Fast Finality on Filecoin (F3) represents one of the [biggest storage-retrieval lifecycle improvements to date](https://x.com/FilFoundation/status/1816890979032727563), where new onchain storage contracts from other networks can now interface with Filecoin. By reducing confirmation periods for Filecoin storage service events, F3 is a big improvement for Filecoin builders. With F3, finalization times are sped up by 450x to just minutes, improving user experience and opening the door for applications, exchanges, and interoperability on the network. Learn more about how F3 is contributing to the evolution of the network and get involved by joining the [Filecoin community in Bangkok](https://lu.ma/filecoin?tag=fil%20bangkok%202024).

## Growing the Network with Programmability, Smart Contracts, and Dapps

Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM) brings onchain programmability and smart contracts to Filecoin Mainnet. Dapps can tap into storage primitives on Filecoin with valuable workflows including perpetual storage, data access control, compute-over-data, Data DAOs, and more. As of October 15, 2024, more than 4,400 unique contracts are supporting 3 million total transactions — highlighting the community’s ongoing innovation. With user programmability, the network’s capabilities are expanding to new frontiers of creativity and technological advancements within the ecosystem.

## Redefining the Power of Compute

Thanks to our network of more than 2,100 storage provider systems globally contributing more than 4.5 exbibytes of raw storage capacity to the network, Filecoin is the leading protocol for decentralized storage and is at the forefront of enabling decentralized compute. Projects like [Bacalhau](/ecosystem-explorer/bacalhau), [Ramo](https://www.ramo.io/), [Fluence](/ecosystem-explorer/fluence) and [Bagel](/ecosystem-explorer/bagel) are just some of the teams using the FVM to broker computational resources, incentivize compute execution, and distribute workloads across available storage providers, offering a compelling alternative to centralized models.
