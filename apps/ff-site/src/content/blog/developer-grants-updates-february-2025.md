Welcome back to the Developer Grants Updates series! Since our [last update](/blog/developer-grants-updates-august-2024), Filecoin Foundation has continued to support new, impactful projects and introduced program updates to empower more developers in the Filecoin ecosystem.

## New Grant Opportunity: FIL Builder Next Step Grants

Filecoin Foundation (FF) is working with [FIL-B](https://fil.builders/) to provide FIL Builder Next Step Grants valued between $5,000 and $10,000. This grant type is intended to support builders taking their active Filecoin projects to the next level! 

Are you working on an onchain Filecoin project that incorporates the [Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM)](https://fvm.filecoin.io/)? Do you have a proof of concept or a solid background in Web3 development? This grant might be perfect for you! Review the [Builder Next Step Grants criteria and scope](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/blob/master/Program%20Resources/Builder%20Next%20Step%20Grants.md) to learn more.

FIL Builder Next Steps Grants are open for applications: the official review process kicked off on December 1, 2024, and will run through April 30, 2025. [Documentation Enhancement Grants](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/blob/master/Program%20Resources/Documentation%20Enhancement%20Grants%20README.md), launched in May 2024, are now included in the Next Step Grants. 

## Focus Areas and Outlook

In addition to the FIL Builder Next Step Grants, we are continuing to award grants valued at up to $50,000 for projects that align with the following focus areas. 

- Developer and Data Tooling: Close important experience gaps for developers building on Filecoin.
- Integrations: Add integration or support for Filecoin into popular or fast-growing tools and developer communities.
- Research and Protocols: Improve the foundations of Filecoin through protocol research and development.
- Storage: Develop scalable solutions in storage markets, including improved data onboarding tools.
- Retrieval: Focus on retrieval solutions for Filecoin, such as tools that optimize retrieval services and enhance user experiences in the wider retrieval ecosystem.
- FVM: Advance FVM capabilities through mechanisms like rollups, core functionality improvements, and integrations of Filecoin with new and existing tools or protocols.

A few proposals that we recently funded include:

- [Eastore](/ecosystem-explorer/eastore): An onchain way of storing small files on Filecoin, as an alternative to traditional centralized file storage protocols. Eastore is built with FVM, allowing users to store files through smart contract transactions. This drive-like interface over FVM simplifies access to Filecoin’s decentralized storage, encouraging more users to join the network 
- [UCAN development support](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/issues/1776): A project supporting the development of multiple User Controlled Authorization Network (UCAN) functionalities, including v1 JS UCAN implementation, debugger, and other developer tooling and resources for ecosystem projects using UCANs. This work can help the Filecoin network provide decentralized storage and retrieval services, particularly for projects in our network using UCANs, like [Storacha](/ecosystem-explorer/storacha-network). 
- [IPNI Reverse Index](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/issues/1781): This project will help assess the quality of Filecoin retrieval services and drive improvements. The results of this work have the potential to empower developers to build alternative retrieval-probing networks, new reputation systems, and an array of diagnostic tooling.

For a more comprehensive look at developer projects we have funded in the past, check out Filecoin Foundation’s [2024 Annual Report](/blog/filecoin-foundation-2024-annual-report). 

If you have a project in mind that improves or advances the Filecoin network, we encourage you to apply for a grant! Make sure to check out [our grant criteria](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/blob/master/Program%20Resources/Builder%20Next%20Step%20Grants.md) to inform your proposals.

## Stay connected to the Filecoin Developer Community

There are many ways to receive support within the Filecoin community in addition to applying for a Developer Grant. We invite you to take advantage of these opportunities.

- Attend [Code n’ Corgi](https://lu.ma/gd767xu5) at ETHDenver: Join us for ​a community gathering for Filecoin builders and friends! This developer-driven series is designed for builders in the Filecoin ecosystem as a perfect launchpad to kickstart your Web3 journey or take it to new heights. Expect hands-on workshops, engaging demos, and meaningful connections that spark collaboration and drive innovation. Happening February 28 from 4:00 - 8:00 PM MST! 
- Join the [Developer Working Group](https://github.com/filecoin-project/DeveloperWG): This monthly meeting connects Filecoin developers and community members to discuss key areas of interest across the developer community. 
- Join FF's Developer Grants team for [Filecoin Grants Office Hours](https://calendly.com/filecoin-grants/office-hours-ama?month=2024-07) to learn more about the Filecoin Grants program and ask any questions. 
- [Take advantage of Filecoin Foundation's Comms Toolkit](https://hub.fil.org/comms): Already building on Filecoin? This site connects you with FF’s Marketing and Communications team so we can help spread the word about the work you’re doing in the Filecoin ecosystem.

Thank you for your interest in the Developer Grants program. Stay tuned for more updates and program developments!
