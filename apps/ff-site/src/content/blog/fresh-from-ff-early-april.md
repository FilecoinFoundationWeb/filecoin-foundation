_Check out the latest updates about what Filecoin Foundation team has been up to._

## Early April Highlights

📖 **Filecoin Foundation is now accepting article abstracts from the community for the inaugural edition of the Filecoin Ecosystem Digest.** Published by FF and guest edited by Ansa Research’s Jonathan Victor, the digest will feature articles from ecosystem contributors sharing their vision for the web's future and how decentralized storage applications will play a part. To apply, fill out the [Filecoin Ecosystem Digest interest form](https://airtable.com/appQReX5uAegC0yom/pagoKQqs5z4LCWleW/form).

🧰 **Filecoin Foundation’s [Comms Toolkit](https://hub.fil.org/comms) is live!** This new site connects you with FF’s Marketing and Communications team so we can help spread the word about projects you're building and the work you’re doing in the Filecoin ecosystem. Fill out this [intake form](https://airtable.com/appNJXvQHmep8Dx9E/shr3Kc8Ort7T5ehuX), and our team will follow up with you to help you tell your story.

📈**Submissions to the Filecoin Ecosystem Explorer have doubled since its launch in January!** The [Filecoin Ecosystem Explorer](/ecosystem-explorer) is a crowd-sourced and open database that showcases the incredible breadth of projects in the Filecoin ecosystem. Thank you to all of those who have submitted use cases and applications! If you’re working on something in the Filecoin ecosystem and don’t yet see your project, [submit it through the Ecosystem Explorer project form](/ecosystem-explorer/project-form).

## Ecosystem

### Developer Advocacy

- Twenty-one teams submitted Filecoin-related projects in the Dora Hacks [Data Economy Hackathon](https://dorahacks.io/hackathon/filecoin-data-economy). Teams focused on scalability, building on Filecoin, and maximizing data utility. Winners will be announced April 15.
- FF Developer Advocate Jenks Guo judged the [Filecoin track at ETH London](https://ethglobal.com/events/london2024/prizes/filecoin), which drew 26 submissions and offered six top prizes.

### Storage

- FF’s Community & Data Onboarding team hosted its first [Network Growth 2.0 call](https://filecoinproject.slack.com/archives/C02GQUMFQVA/p1711138050905809) on March 22, where builders throughout the ecosystem came together to give a high-level view of what they’re working on. The first call featured Cloud Forest, Web3Mine, CID Gravity, [Seal Storage](/ecosystem-explorer/seal-storage), and more. Join the [\#global-storage-provider-community](https://filecoinproject.slack.com/archives/C02GQUMFQVA) Slack channel for details on future meetings.
- The Decentralized Storage Alliance (DSA), of which FF is a founding member, announced a leap forward in zk proof computation on the Filecoin network. These advances optimize several key steps in the proof process via CPU and GPU optimizations. The result is an 80% reduction in cost and latency for proof generation – saving storage providers money, and increasing flexibility in how they use their hardware.

## Network Operations

### Governance

- The FF Governance team held its monthly Community Governance Call on March 25. Subscribe to the [governance calendar](https://bit.ly/3T4NKAa) to get the meeting details and to stay updated.

- The first DataCap distributions have started to go out to allocators. The initial amount of 5 PiB allows new allocators to begin distributing while developing their diligence and bookkeeping records. For more information, you can attend upcoming meetings by adding the [Fil Plus Governance meeting calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/1?cid=Y19rMWdrZm9vbTE3ZzBqOGM2YmFtNnVmNDNqMEBncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t) or view the recordings on [Filecoin Foundation's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLp3zrT1ewY0kYN1hJpERMUxTCbFC4yZwN).
