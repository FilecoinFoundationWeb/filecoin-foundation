## Your Data. Your Choice. Your Control.

The future of storage isn’t just about where data lives –– it’s also about who controls it. Filecoin puts that power back in your hands –– redefining data ownership in the digital age. 

Today, a handful of corporations control most of the world’s data. This approach creates single points of failure, limited transparency, and costly pricing models with few real alternatives. More importantly, it means you ultimately do not control your data. 

Combining blockchain technology with decentralized storage offers a fundamentally different approach to data storage. And by distributing data across a decentralized, global network, Filecoin creates a foundation for a more open, resilient, and user-controlled digital future.

### Why Store Your Data with Filecoin?

**Resilience**: Built to Withstand – With Filecoin, you can store multiple copies of your data, distributed across a global network of independent providers, eliminating single points of failure and protecting against loss. 

**Integrity**: Don’t Trust, Verify  – For every piece of data stored on the Filecoin network cryptographic proofs guarantee that data is preservedunchanged.

**Scalability**: Storage that Grows with Emerging Technology – Data generation is growing exponentially; Filecoin is the only decentralized storage project to scale to exabytes of data ––  with the capacity to meet global data demands.

**Cost Efficiency:** A Smarter Storage Economy – With a competitive, open marketplace for storage, you can choose from a range of providers based on performance or price. Content-addressability and IPFS support means you can pick and switch fearlessly.
