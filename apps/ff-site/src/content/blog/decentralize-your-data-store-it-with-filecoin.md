## Your Data. Your Choice. Your Control.

The future of storage isn’t just about where data lives –– it’s also about who controls it. Filecoin puts that power back in your hands –– redefining data ownership in the digital age. 

Today, a handful of corporations control most of the world’s data. This approach creates single points of failure, limited transparency, and costly pricing models with few real alternatives. More importantly, it means you ultimately do not control your data. 

Combining blockchain technology with decentralized storage offers a fundamentally different approach to data storage. And by distributing data across a decentralized, global network, Filecoin creates a foundation for a more open, resilient, and user-controlled digital future.

### Why Store Your Data with Filecoin?

**Resilience**: Built to Withstand – With Filecoin, you can store multiple copies of your data, distributed across a global network of independent providers, eliminating single points of failure and protecting against loss. 

**Integrity**: Don’t Trust, Verify  – For every piece of data stored on the Filecoin network cryptographic proofs guarantee that data is preservedunchanged.

**Scalability**: Storage that Grows with Emerging Technology – Data generation is growing exponentially; Filecoin is the only decentralized storage project to scale to exabytes of data ––  with the capacity to meet global data demands.

**Cost Efficiency:** A Smarter Storage Economy – With a competitive, open marketplace for storage, you can choose from a range of providers based on performance or price. Content-addressability and IPFS support means you can pick and switch fearlessly.

Who Is Using Filecoin?

### Web3 Projects 

FF is building bridges with other ecosystems to enhance decentralization and resilience in the broader Web3 world.

**Cardano**: [Blockfrost integrated Filecoin](https://fil.org/blog/blockfrost-and-filecoin-foundation-collaborate-to-enhance-the-decentralization-of-cardano-data) as a robust backup layer for Blockfrost-built Cardano apps. Blockfrost will also introduce a new service tier for Cardano builders that includes IPFS and Filecoin storage. 

**Solana**: DCENT, a Filecoin storage provider, collaborated with the Solana ecosystem to archive [Solana’s block history on Filecoin](https://destor.com/resources/news/solana-integrates-filecoin) as part of the [Old Faithful initiative](https://docs.triton.one/project-yellowstone/old-faithful-historical-archive/old-faithful-public-report) to make Solana's ledger data accessible and content-addressable. 

### AI Organizations

AI organizations, including [Aethir](https://fil.org/ecosystem-explorer/aethir), [KiteAI](https://fil.org/ecosystem-explorer/kite-ai), [Nuklai](https://fil.org/ecosystem-explorer/nuklai), and [SingularityNET](https://singularitynet.io/), store datasets and metadata on the network to ensure transparency, accountability, and robust audit trails.

AI agent projects are leveraging the Filecoin network’s data verifiability capabilities to ensure AI-generated outputs can be trusted, including [Recall](https://recall.network/), [Ungate AI](https://fil.org/ecosystem-explorer/ungate), and [AIWS](https://fil.org/ecosystem-explorer/aiws). Plus, platforms like [Theoriq](https://www.theoriq.ai/) have [developed a series of AI agents](https://mirror.xyz/0xbCAa90C8bA95b3ba6C8Aa6900a92FE70b97E5eF7/y8zj9hbr6ZEES9V9bMtqyzEBm0osh5ivoSBEYVN3mkI) trained on data stored on Filecoin, making open data more accessible and usable for builders. 

### Journalists & Researchers

Journalistic records are among the most vulnerable information online, subject to link rot, censorship, and disappearance under centralized control. It’s not unlikely to see an archive vanish overnight, and it has happened to [government datasets](https://cyber.harvard.edu/story/2025-01/archivists-work-identify-and-save-thousands-datasets-disappearing-datagov), [political polling,](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/05/abc-news-538-shut-down) and [reporting records](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/mtv-news-saved-internet-archive-1235051776/). In the age of AI, preserving and verifying journalism and research has never been more critical. 

Projects like [The Defiant](https://thedefiant.io/news/defi/the-defiant-to-preserve-article-archives-on-filecoin) and other pioneering organizations, including [MuckRock](https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2024/sep/11/featured-add-on-push-to-ipfs-filecoin/) and [Numbers Protocol](https://votetw2024.numbersprotocol.io/En), use decentralized storage to safeguard archives and reporting, ensuring evidence prevails in an ephemeral era. [Rolling Stone](https://investigation.rollingstone.com/dj-photo-war-crimes-bosnia/) worked with Starling Lab to preserve an investigative journalism archive. 

### Academic Institutions 

Universities and research institutions around the world generate troves of research and data.  But without secure and sustainable infrastructure, that knowledge can be lost –– hampering scientific progress. 

University of Maryland’s EASIER Data Initiative stores [academic tutorials](https://easierdata.org/notebooks/accessing-gedi-data) and [geospatial data](https://easierdata.org/updates/2024/2024-12-6-crop-classification-on-dweb) on Filecoin. UC Berkeley stored [experimental particle physics data](https://physics.berkeley.edu/news-events/news/seal-storage-technology-partners-with-orebi-gann-group). MIT Open Learning uploaded foundational [OpenCourseWare courses](https://fil.org/blog/flickr-foundation-internet-archive-and-other-leading-organizations-leverage-filecoin-to-safeguard-cultural-heritage). By uploading data to Filecoin, these institutions ensure their work is globally accessible, cryptographically verifiable, and resistant to link rot or institutional turnover. 

### Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and Museums

Over [500,000 culturally significant digital artifacts](https://fil.org/blog/flickr-foundation-internet-archive-and-other-leading-organizations-leverage-filecoin-to-safeguard-cultural-heritage) are now safeguarded on the Filecoin network. Institutions like the Smithsonian Institution, Flickr Foundation, Internet Archive, and Starling Lab use decentralized storage to preserve and protect knowledge for future generations. Smithsonian's National Museum of American History uploaded 300 digitized sound recordings –– some of the earliest recordings ever made –– from Alexander Graham Bell.  

## How Filecoin Works For You

### 1. Upload Your Data
