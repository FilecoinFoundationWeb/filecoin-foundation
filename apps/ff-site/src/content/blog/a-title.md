## What is Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web?

Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web (FFDW) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit that focuses on charitable activities, including building and supporting the decentralized web community, funding research and development, and educating the public about the decentralized web.

All of this work is done with a core goal: to create and support better technology to preserve humanity's most important information. FFDW is a separate organization from the Filecoin Foundation. The following pages highlight FFDW's project partners and provide updates on our work together.
