The Filecoin Plus (Fil+) Round 6 application period is live, offering a prime opportunity for organizations to join the program or for existing Allocators to refine their pathways. **Round 6 submissions are due July 11, 2025.**

Fil+ aims to increase the amount of useful data stored on the Filecoin network. Allocators play a key role in the Fil+ program by verifying and onboarding real client data to the Filecoin network, incentivizing the storage of useful data. Clients can request DataCap from Allocators, each of whom has their own application process. An [Allocator Pathway](https://blog.allocator.tech/2024/04/allocator-tech-blog.html) is a structured process for distributing DataCap on the Filecoin network.

Round 6 introduces an updated application form to streamline diligence standards and ensure smooth [refresh audits](https://github.com/filecoin-project/Allocator-Governance?tab=readme-ov-file#core-review-criteria-for-all-allocators), a process where an Allocator's performance is assessed using both on-chain and off-chain data.

Whether you’re a new organization eager to contribute to Filecoin’s decentralized storage network or an existing Allocator looking to strengthen your role, now is the time to act. This blog post is the first of several updates, with more guides and videos coming soon to support your journey. Here’s what you need to know to get started or stay active in Round 6.

## For New Organizations: Join the Fil+ Program

Round 6 is a chance for new organizations to become Fil+ Allocators, distributing DataCap to drive useful data storage on the Filecoin network. The updated application form simplifies onboarding, especially for [manual pathways](https://www.fidl.tech/news/manual-pathway-metaallocator), thanks to improved tooling and staffing. Here’s how to get started:

- **Apply by July 11:** Visit [apply.allocator.tech](https://apply.allocator.tech/) and complete the Airtable form with your organization and pathway details. Ensure your application is business-ready, with defined diligence processes, as applications are evaluated for quality, completeness, and accuracy.
- **Define Your Pathway:** Specify your diligence approach (e.g., Manual or Automated). If you’re developing a minimum viable pathway (MVP), consider applying to the [Experimental Pathway first](https://www.fidl.tech/apply-for-datacap_1).
- **Complete KYC:** After submission, return to the dashboard to finalize KYC for the organization.
- **Start Strong:** New Allocators begin with 5 PiB of DataCap, with the potential to grow through refresh requests following the doubling model (5 PiB > 10 PiB > 20 PiB).

You can even make multiple applications to serve varied data needs, such as public datasets or enterprise clients, as long as overlap is minimal and accounted for.

Before you start, make sure you created a github bookkeeping repository and have a multisig which will be used to receive and manage the datacap allocations. If you have trouble setting this up, the Fil+ governance team can help, but it may delay your onboarding.

Apply early to leverage Fil+ community resources and Governance Team feedback via the [Allocator-Registry](https://apply.allocator.tech/dashboard) to ensure a smooth start.

## For Existing Allocators: Resubmit to Stay Active

For current Allocators, Round 6 is your opportunity to update your pathway information to align with enhanced diligence standards, ensuring seamless refresh audits, and continued DataCap allocation.

**All Allocators must resubmit by July 11, 2025.** Round 5 applications don’t carry over. Here’s how to stay active:

- **Resubmit by July 11:** Go to [apply.allocator.tech](https://apply.allocator.tech/) and update your pathway details in the Airtable form, reflecting your current diligence process (e.g., Manual if you’ve shifted from Automated).
- **Use Your Existing Address:** Reapplying with the same address links to your prior history and reputation, streamlining the process.
- **Complete KYC:** Finalize KYC on the dashboard post-submission.
- **Address Past Issues:** If your pathway was inactive or faced non-compliance in Round 5, address what steps you’ve taken to resolve these in your updated application.

Your existing DataCap will roll over from the MetaAllocator, and high-quality Allocators reusing their address may retain higher DataCap tranches based on past activity. You can also apply for multiple pathways to expand your impact, ensuring each is specialized with minimal overlap. If you’re developing new tools (e.g., Automated pathways), submit an [Experimental Pathway](/blog/making-space-for-experimentation-the-experimental-pathway-metaallocator) application alongside your Manual one. The Governance Team will provide feedback via the [Allocator-Registry](https://apply.allocator.tech/dashboard) to keep you on track.

This Round 6 update is your chance to join or strengthen your role in Fil+’s mission to scale decentralized storage. Stay tuned for upcoming guides and videos to make the process even easier. For now, explore Fil+ community resources or reach out to the Governance Team for support. Let’s make Round 6 a milestone for the Filecoin ecosystem!
