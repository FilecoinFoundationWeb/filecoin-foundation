​​**Filecoin Ecosystem Metrics Roundup: Building a Data-Driven Foundation for Growth.** The Filecoin Ecosystem Metrics Roundup is a monthly series designed to align the Filecoin community around the metrics driving sustainable ecosystem growth. Centered on metrics education, analysis, and optimization; this series was created to support data-informed decision-making throughout the Filecoin ecosystem by increasing transparency around key contributions to ecosystem growth, proposing actionable next steps, and establishing a shared understanding of where our ecosystem stands and where it's headed.

**Saving the Story: Preserving Journalism in the Age of Digital Decay.** Filecoin Foundation’s sister non-profit, Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web (FFDW), is working with [Fasila](https://www.fasila-inc.com/), an organization dedicated to supporting local journalism, to help fortify media infrastructure for the future. Few sectors are more vulnerable to digital decay than journalism and media, where traditional news archives are often stored on centralized servers, and remain susceptible to corporate decisions, cyberattacks, policy changes, or technical failures that can erase decades of reporting in an instant. Technologies like Filecoin and IPFS offer a fundamentally different approach to digital preservation, providing resilient, tamper-resistant storage that ensures critical stories, investigations, and archives remain accessible and verifiable for the long term.

**Filecoin Plus: Join as a New Allocator or Update Your Existing Pathway.** The Filecoin Plus (Fil+) Round 6 application period is live, offering a prime opportunity for organizations to join the program or for existing Allocators to refine their pathways. Allocators play a key role in the Fil+ program by verifying and onboarding real client data to the Filecoin network, incentivizing the storage of useful data. Round 6 submissions are due July 11, 2025.

## Ecosystem

- Filecoin Foundation's Quality Engineering team supported the release of [Singularity v0.6.0-RC2](https://github.com/data-preservation-programs/singularity/releases). The update introduces smarter padding of small data/DAG pieces, reducing overhead and improving Curio compatibility, making data prepared by Singularity fully retrievable. 
- Filecoin Foundation is supporting the **[Hack The Sovereign Data Layer with Filecoin](https://plgenesis.devspot.app/en?activeTab=overview&challenge=filecoin-foundation)** challenge, part of the PL Genesis Modular Worlds Hackathon running through July 6 with $15K in total prizes. With a focus on projects that can store and retrieve based on smart contract logic, build developer-first tooling, or explore other impactful use cases like Data DAO, archives, and verifiable AI training data, this hackathon allows builders to create new primitives with Filecoin's onchain infrastructure.
- Orbit is entering a new chapter! Filecoin Foundation is teaming up with [FIL-B](http://fil.builders), who will be guiding the program execution through the next phase in close collaboration with the Filecoin Foundation. FIL-B is reimagining the Orbit Program as its Operator to foster even greater impact, and that includes introducing new specialized roles designed to recognize diverse contributions and amplify the community's collective reach. Filecoin Foundation remains the Program Owner — guiding strategy, messaging, and funding.

## Network Operations

### Governance

- There are updates to three Filecoin Improvement Proposals (FIPS), the primary mechanism by which the Filecoin community can submit, discuss, and approve changes relevant to the Filecoin network:
- [FIP-0077](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/tree/master/FIPS/fip-0077.md), a proposal implementing a deposit requirement for creating new miner actors to prevent unnecessary miner ID creation and potential network spam attacks, is in Last Call.
- FIP-[0082](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/tree/master/FIPS/fip-0082.md), a proposal to add functionality for submitting several sector update proofs (as a single Groth16 aggregate proof) using a single message, has been Accepted
- FIP-[0101](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/tree/master/FIPS/fip-0101.md), a proposal to remove the ProveCommitAggregate method (Method 26) from the miner actor, has been Accepted.

### Fil Plus
