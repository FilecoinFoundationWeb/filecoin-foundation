At FIL Dev Summit 7 (FDS-7) in Buenos Aires, Filecoin Foundation’s Governance team launched the [Constellation Program](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9_-O-wgw7A), a community-driven initiative to evolve and modernize Filecoin governance. 

Constellation is a phased and modular strategy to enhance decision-making and resource allocation across the network. Its name reflects the vision: each participant in the ecosystem is a vital, distinct star, and together, they form a navigational structure to guide progress. Rather than a sweeping overhaul, each Constellation module is piloted, tested in real conditions, and refined before broader adoption.

## A Modular Path Forward

The Constellation Program takes an iterative approach to governance reform, rolling out updates in three distinct phases: **Nebula, Nexus, and Galaxy.** 

**Nebula**, the phase currently underway, focuses on governance foundations, incentives, and experiments. This phase is about designing, testing, and laying the groundwork for Filecoin’s future governance systems. These early-stage initiatives are foundational experiments that will shape how decisions are made and how the ecosystem functions at scale. Here’s a look at what’s currently underway: 

- **Exploring decision models:** In collaboration with [CryptoEconLab](https://cryptoeconlab.com/) (CEL), the Governance team is developing and testing decision-making models that strengthen alignment between stakeholder incentives and the network’s long-term goals. These models aim to support sustainable funding for public goods and more resilient governance structures.
- **Rolling out new incentives for Allocators and Storage Providers (SPs):** In collaboration with [Filecoin Incentive Design Labs](https://www.fidl.tech/) (FIDL), new incentive models are being tested to improve accountability and outcomes for Storage Providers and FIL+ allocators, including clearer performance metrics and experimental allocation frameworks. 
- **Operational excellence in the FIP process:** The Filecoin Improvement Proposal (FIP) process is being enhanced to bring greater clarity, structure, and resilience. These efforts aim to introduce clearer pathways for proposal development, more defined responsibilities, and safeguards to support secure, accountable protocol evolution. 
- **Building a new voting app interface and governance dashboard:** A redesigned voting interface and governance dashboard are in development to improve usability, transparency, and visibility into proposals, participation, and governance metrics.
- **Archiving governance data with [Cha-Ching](https://cha-ching.it/) and Filecoin Onchain Cloud**: Governance artifacts and decision records are being archived directly on Filecoin, creating a transparent, auditable record while enabling new incentives for governance participation. Cha-Ching is a project building on Filecoin Onchain Cloud, archiving governance data and turning GitHub activity into potential rewards for developers. 

**Nexus** is the alignment phase, where the emphasis shifts from design to scale as foundational structures take root, governance responsibilities expand, and actors begin coordinating around shared norms. This phase focuses on piloting new models where community stakeholders participate in key decision-making. Protocol logic is increasingly encoded onchain, reducing reliance on ad hoc coordination and establishing shared accountability.

Eventually, the system will graduate to **Galaxy**, a mature governance framework where the protocol evolves via onchain rules; funding mechanisms are transparent and auditable; and governance itself evolves through clearly defined mechanisms, not reactive interventions.

## Introducing veFIL: Aligning Long-Term Incentives

CEL [introduced a concept for veFIL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoDJgLNirmw), a vote-escrow token model inspired by veCRV from Curve Finance. veFIL is designed to empower long-term stakeholders by giving them rewards and time-weighted voting power in the governance of Filecoin’s public goods ecosystem.

The premise is simple: FIL holders who commit their tokens for longer periods receive more voting power in ecosystem funding rounds. Participants can lock FIL for a specified time period, receiving veFIL in return, which they can use to vote on the allocation of funds to public goods programs, like RetroPGF and ProPGF.

veFIL will focus on a specific domain: ensuring that public goods funding is community-governed, economically aligned, and resistant to centralization. This structure rewards early adopters while aiming to transition Filecoin’s public goods ecosystem toward long-term sustainability.

As part of the economic pillar of the Constellation Program, the Governance team is actively engaging with the community on reform proposals like this one, exploring parameters, such as vesting schedules, emission caps, and potential safeguards. The design is still evolving, and community feedback is not only welcome but essential. Follow governance discussions and proposals in [GitHub](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/discussions). 

Public goods programs such as RetroPGF and ProPGF have already funded hundreds of projects across infrastructure, tooling, education, and governance. veFIL builds on this momentum by bringing long-term stakeholders into community decision-making through a transparent, credible, onchain system for public goods funding — one that ensures those decisions are informed and sustained by long-term commitment.
