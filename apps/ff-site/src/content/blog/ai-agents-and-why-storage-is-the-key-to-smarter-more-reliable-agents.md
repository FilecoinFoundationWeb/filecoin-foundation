AI agents – systems that can take actions autonomously to execute tasks, make decisions, and interact with other services or users – are reshaping how we engage with technology. 

The first wave of AI agents already offer basic task automation, retrieval-augmented generation, and chatbot-like interactions. So how can the next wave of AI agent builders stand out in an increasingly crowded market?

The answer lies in verifiability. AI agents process large amounts of data to make decisions, but what matters is the ability to trace their reasoning - knowing where the data comes from, how it's used, and the logic behind the output. This information must be transparent and verifiable by others. For example, if an AI relies on faulty data and makes a bad decision, it’s not enough to see the outcome - you need to inspect the inputs, follow its thought process, and double-check its conclusions.

Today, AI's reliance on centralized infrastructure not only limits transparency and user control but also introduces systemic risks related to data access, security, and verifiability - challenges that decentralized approaches can help address. 

By leveraging decentralized storage networks like Filecoin that provide data verifiability and cryptographic proofs, agent builders can create AI systems that are more resilient, transparent, and scalable than their centralized counterparts.

## AI Agent Challenges

AI agents are designed to function autonomously, making decisions based on large-scale datasets and machine learning models. They continuously evolve through new interactions and data inputs. 

However, most AI systems today operate within [centralized infrastructures](https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2024/05/the-scramble-for-ai-computing-power/), where access to data, model training, and decision-making processes remain opaque. This creates fundamental challenges. For example, AI training data is often proprietary and inaccessible, making it difficult to verify how the dataset’s models consume in the process of reasoning to generate insights. 

This fundamentally limits AI’s transparency, verifiability, and resilience.

## Why Decentralized Storage Makes Sense for AI Agents

Filecoin provides the underlying storage layer to power verifiable, tamper-proof, and permissionless AI models, ensuring that AI-generated outputs can be trusted. Here’s how:

- Data verifiability: When it comes to AI, garbage in is garbage out. If you input faulty data into models, you can expect faulty results. Having an open and robust record of AI data provenance and lineage, and assurance that data has not been tampered with, ensures AI models are trained on reliable datasets, promoting trust in AI agent decision-making.
- Scalability: The demand for data is skyrocketing, with AI agents driving us rapidly into the exabyte era of data collection. Today’s pressing issue is the sheer scale of data needed to power AI systems. Filecoin is built to accommodate storage in the petabyte and even exbibyte level.
- Immutability and Proof of Storage: Filecoin creates an auditable and tamper-proof record for AI companies to record their models, datasets, and results. As regulations around AI tighten, AI companies and major organizations using AI services may soon be required to demonstrate the history and integrity of the data source used to populate their models. Filecoin’s Proof-of-Spacetime mechanism constantly verifies that data is stored correctly and securely, providing proof that it has not been tampered with, and helping those building AI models remain compliant and users feel confident in how AI models operate.
- Resiliency: Filecoin relies on a distributed network of global storage providers to store multiple copies of data, rather than large corporations with single points of failure, promoting data availability and uptime for AI agents.
- Resource Optimization: AI agents require massive GPU and CPU resources for performance. Decentralized compute networks create alternatives to centralized models by using cryptoeconomic incentives to motivate individuals to allocate their unused resources to the network, creating a more distributed and cost-effective marketplace. 
- Onchain AI Agents: Unlike traditional cloud-hosted AI, which remains under corporate control, AI agents leveraging decentralized infrastructure can establish cryptographic proof of their intelligence and transact autonomously within a trustless environment. This is critical for enabling AI systems that can function transparently and persist without depending on human-controlled intervention.

## AI Agents Leveraging Filecoin’s Infrastructure

Several AI agent projects are already incorporating Filecoin’s decentralized storage.

[Recall](https://recall.network/)is building a reputation system for AI agents to ensure they operate on high-integrity, verifiable data. As a foundational intelligence layer, Recall enables agents to prove, monetize, and exchange knowledge in a decentralized, trustless way. Beyond verification, Recall serves as a multi-agent marketplace, allowing AI agents to trade knowledge and skills, reduce redundancy, and accelerate collective intelligence. 

Imagine a meal planning agent that could source dietary adjustments from a diabetes management agent, ensuring customized recommendations. Built as an [Interplanetary Consensus](https://github.com/consensus-shipyard) (IPC) subnet, Recall plans to store agent data on Filecoin.

[Theoriq](https://mirror.xyz/0xbCAa90C8bA95b3ba6C8Aa6900a92FE70b97E5eF7/y8zj9hbr6ZEES9V9bMtqyzEBm0osh5ivoSBEYVN3mkI) is a protocol that facilitates the coordination of and communication between AI agents. Theoriq and Filecoin Foundation are working to develop a series of AI agents trained on data from the Filecoin network, making open data more accessible and usable to developers and researchers. A [Filecoin AI agent](https://infinity.theoriq.ai/) trained on the Filecoin docs and GitHub repositories allows users to get answers through natural language queries on how to build on Filecoin, troubleshoot common issues, getting started as a storage provider, and more.

[Ungate AI](/ecosystem-explorer/ungate) is a platform that facilitates AI agent-to-agent communication, leveraging Filecoin and Eigenlayer to build a trust layer for AI in order to avoid hidden human override or external manipulation occurring without detection. Ungate relies on Filecoin’s decentralized storage to store metadata, ensuring AI agent execution proofs are immutably recorded and permanently accessible.

[AIWS](/ecosystem-explorer/aiws) is creating a modular network for generating and managing autonomous AI agents fully integrated with decentralized storage and compute stacks. All AI agent metadata, prompts, and data are preserved on Filecoin.

[Storacha AI](/ecosystem-explorer/storacha-network) is an AI-native decentralized storage layer, designed to power autonomous AI workflows with trustless, high-performance storage. AI agents can independently save the outputs it generates, fetch the information it needs, and share results with other agents, all on its own. Picture autonomous research teams, cross-organization AI collaboration, and personal AI collections of assistants - all unlocked by collaboration from freeing agents from centralized constraints.

## The Future of AI: User-Controlled Intelligence

As AI becomes increasingly embedded in daily life, the demand for personal agency over AI systems will grow exponentially. Users—both individuals and organizations—will seek AI agents that align with their specific needs while respecting data sovereignty.

Filecoin's decentralized infrastructure enables a fundamental shift in this relationship by:

1. True ownership: Users can deploy AI agents that operate on their own terms, with verifiable guarantees that their data remains under their control.
2. Customization without compromise: Organizations can fine-tune AI systems to their specific use cases without sacrificing resilience or increasing vendor lock-in.
3. Transparent intelligence: Every insight generated is backed by an immutable record of data provenance, creating greater accountability.
4. Persistent accessibility: Unlike opaque, corporate-controlled AI that may change policies or shut down services, Filecoin-powered agents can maintain consistent operation and data access.

For developers building the next generation of AI agents, this infrastructure offers a critical competitive advantage. In a market where [users are increasingly concerned about data privacy and AI trustworthiness](https://www.axios.com/2025/02/13/trust-ai-china-us), systems built on verifiable foundations will command premium positioning.

Filecoin provides the essential infrastructure for building AI that's not just smart, but transparent, accountable, and trustworthy — attributes that will ultimately determine which AI systems thrive in the long term.
