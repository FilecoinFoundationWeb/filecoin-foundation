### Filecoin Orbit Events

It’s hard to believe, but the Filecoin network has been in orbit for a year already, following the highly anticipated Filecoin Mainnet Liftoff on October 15th, 2020. In the year since, significant achievements have been made with Filecoin cementing its place as an integral component of the decentralized web3 stack!

Help us celebrate this and other remarkable milestones from the past twelve months — and look ahead to what’s coming next at Filecoin Orbit — a series of community-hosted events across the globe this week.

The celebrations kicked off yesterday, with six events already taking place. This will continue throughout the week, concluding with a two-day virtual conference hosted by Protocol Labs featuring keynotes from Juan Benet, Brewster Kahle, Zooko, and more!

### October IPFS + Filecoin Orbit Meetup

5:30 AM PDT

It’s been a long time since the last time we've met. There’s a bunch of researchers and developers working on super cool projects involving IPFS/IPLD and libp2p in town, so we thought it’s a good idea to schedule a meetup around the event. More importantly, it also has been a year since the Filecoin mainnet launch, where those technologies play a crucial part and there are several events being organised around the world, as well as virtually. It’s a great idea to have Munich as one of the meeting hubs! So let’s meet again in person. The exact location still needs to be determined, but it will be in the city center.
