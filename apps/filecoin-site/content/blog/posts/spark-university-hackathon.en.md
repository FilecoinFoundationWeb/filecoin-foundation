Filecoin is excited to be a challenge partner in the [Spark University Hackathon](https://encode.club/), an 8 week online competition bringing together developers from universities around the world, to learn, build, and launch new applications and storage solutions on the Filecoin network.

The hackathon, which commences on June 15th, will feature virtual presentations, group workshops, competitions, and community hangouts. Students and developers will learn about working in a Web3 world and building on the Filecoin and IPFS network. There are 2 Filecoin challenges with £10k to be won across 6 prizes.

## CHALLENGE 1

Build a system for storing, retrieving, and verifying scientific or other research data on Filecoin. Filecoin will store treasure troves of critically important public data, such as encyclopedias, open access scientific papers, Creative Commons data sets, historical documents, and literature. In this challenge, you will explore those possibilities for storing, using, and distributing public data. You may wish to take advantage of Filecoin’s data integrity & verification capabilities, or reference the [Starling Storage project](https://starlingstorage.io/) for inspiration.

## CHALLENGE 2

Build a system or app for the decentralized web that stores data on both IPFS and Filecoin, and demonstrates some convenience aspects of shared features between the two networks such as shared content identifiers (CID). Filecoin and IPFS are complementary protocols for storing and sharing data in the decentralized web. While users aren’t required to use Filecoin and IPFS together, the two combined solve significant failings of the current web 2.0 infrastructure. You may wish to use the [‘UseIpfs’ flag](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/1843) in the lotus node, or the [powergate client](https://github.com/textileio/js-powergate-client) which provides a single JS API that talks to both networks.
