### Fast Finality (F3) Reaches 80% Participation‚ÄîFilecoin Prepares for Upgrade

The future of faster, more reliable transactions on Filecoin is almost here‚ÄîF3 (Fast Finality) passive testing has already hit 80% network participation! With activation expected after network version 25 in early April, this major upgrade will significantly enhance transaction speeds and efficiency across the network. As Filecoin moves closer to full deployment, the momentum behind F3 underscores the community‚Äôs commitment to scalability and performance. [Stay tuned on X](https://x.com/Filecoin/status/1895851797148844410) as the countdown to activation continues!

### FIP-0100: Enhancing Filecoin‚Äôs Economics and Scalability

Filecoin is set for a major economic and scalability upgrade with FIP-0100, which introduces three key changes to optimize network efficiency. The proposal removes batch fees from PreCommit and ProveCommit operations, reducing gas costs and incentivizing proof aggregation. It also replaces the batch balancer with a more predictable per-sector fee tied to quality-adjusted power, ensuring sustainable network value accrual. Additionally, FIP-0100 eliminates constraints that previously limited batch sizes, improving overall scalability. These updates mark a significant step toward a more efficient and cost-effective Filecoin network. For all of the details, please read the [FIP on GitHub](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0100.md).¬†

### Humanode Brings Biometric Sybil Resistance to Filecoin

The Humanode Biomapper c1 SDK is now live on Filecoin, unlocking new possibilities for web3 builders. By integrating biometric-based Sybil resistance, developers can verify unique human users without intrusive KYC processes - just a quick, private face scan. As a cryptobiometric Layer-1 blockchain, Humanode ensures one human = one node = one vote, making it easier than ever to prevent Sybil attacks. With Filecoin‚Äôs decentralized storage and verifiable cryptographic proofs, this integration strengthens security and trust across web3 applications. Developers can start building with Biomapper today - [check out the SDK](https://humanode-network.github.io/biomapper-sdk/) and [documentation](https://docs.biomapper.hmnd.app/) to get started!

### The PDP Journey Continues: Advancing Proof of Data Possession

In this second installment of The PDP Journey series, we dive deeper into Proof of Data Possession (PDP) as it moves toward Mainnet. At its core, PDP uses ProofSets to ensure secure client-provider relationships and efficient data verification. The architecture relies on two key contracts: the Verifier Contract, managing ProofSets and proofs, and the Listener Contract, handling fault detection and business logic. PDP‚Äôs lightweight proving system enables secure, CPU-friendly verification without specialized hardware. With flexible governance and expansion plans, PDP is set to transform Filecoin‚Äôs hot storage landscape. Join the conversation on #fil-pdp in [Filecoin Slack](http://filecoin.io/slack)!
