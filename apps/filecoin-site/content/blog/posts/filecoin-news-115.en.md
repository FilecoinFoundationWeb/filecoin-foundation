## ✨ Highlights ✨

### 💸  ProPGF Batch 1: $3.6M Awarded to Ecosystem Builders

The first round of the Filecoin Public Goods Funding (ProPGF) program is complete, with $3.6M in funding awarded to 14 outstanding teams across the Filecoin ecosystem. These projects are building essential infrastructure and tools, from open source developer services to real-world storage integrations, that strengthen the foundation of the Filecoin network. This milestone sets the tone for future rounds, with Batch 2 launching in October 2025.

### 🔥 Storacha x Xenea: Supercharging Decentralized Infrastructure

[Storacha and Xenea are teaming up](https://medium.com/@storacha/storacha-x-xenea-supercharging-decentralized-infrastructure-with-blazing-fast-storage-c05167d8ce73) to bring blazing-fast decentralized hot storage to Xenea’s L1 blockchain and its Decentralized Autonomous Content Storage (DACS) framework. Together, they’re tackling one of the biggest misconceptions in web3: that decentralized equals slow. By combining fast retrieval, programmable IPFS, and content-addressed architectures, the two teams are pushing the boundaries of what’s possible for real-time dapps. [Read more about the partnership](https://medium.com/@storacha/storacha-x-xenea-supercharging-decentralized-infrastructure-with-blazing-fast-storage-c05167d8ce73) or [join the Galxe quest](https://app.galxe.com/quest/storacha/GC361t6TrG) to get involved. 

### ⚙️ Aethir Expands GPU Access for Filecoin SPs

The [Aethir](https://x.com/Filecoin/status/1954231226174226515) network now provides Filecoin storage providers with access to scalable compute capacity across more than 400,000 GPU containers. This includes high-performance NVIDIA H100 and H200 units, unlocking new levels of efficiency for data sealing and compute-heavy workloads. It’s a major step toward decentralizing compute infrastructure at scale — and a win for Filecoin SPs looking to boost performance without massive overhead.

### 🚀 Filecoin Services Alpha Cohort Takes Flight

The [Filecoin Services Alpha Cohort](https://x.com/FILBuilders/status/1955264115825643715) has officially launched, kicking off with a deep dive into the vision behind the Filecoin Onchain Cloud. Key updates include the first Filecoin Warm Storage prototype, Filecoin Pay with trustless payments, and upcoming tools like dashboards, explorers, and Filecoin Pin. Expect a big splash at DevConnect Argentina this fall. The future of verifiable, onchain-native storage is well underway.
