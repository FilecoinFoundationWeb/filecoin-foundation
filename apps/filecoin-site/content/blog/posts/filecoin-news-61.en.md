### **FVM Launch, happening on Pi Day!**

After the completion of the calibrationnet upgrade earlier today, the [Filecoin v18 Hygge upgrade](https://github.com/filecoin-project/community/discussions/74?sort=new#discussioncomment-4912995) is officially on track for March 14th, 2023! This upgrade will officially launch programmability on top of the [Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM)](https://fvm.filecoin.io/) and bring smart contracts to the Filecoin blockchain. This launch will unleash the enormous potential of an open data economy while enabling existing Ethereum tooling to be compatible with Filecoin.

Eventually, FVM will unlock the development of applications, markets, and organizations that will rival the scale and breadth of services offered by centralized cloud providers. To learn more about FVM and start building, check out the [official FVM website](https://fvm.filecoin.io/). See you on March 14th!

### **Filecoin and FVM’s Most Successful Hackathon Yet**

In anticipation of the Ethereum-compatible Filecoin Virtual Machine (FEVM) launching on Filecoin mainnet on March 14th, the Filecoin community recently completed its largest hackathon to date specifically for developers to kick off building with FEVM! In collaboration with ETHGlobal, [FVM Space Warp](https://ethglobal.com/events/spacewarp) ran from January 20th to February 10th with overwhelming support from the developer community. The hackathon had 1,040 hackers from 82 different countries with 279 prize submissions, 24 sponsor prize winners, 33 Filecoin prize winners and 12 EthGlobal finalists!

### **Mapping Value for FVM Mainnet**

Leading up to the [Filecoin Virtual Machine](https://fvm.filecoin.io/)’s mainnet launch on March 14th, a series of Impact Evaluator rounds are empowering the community of FVM builders and experts to assess and reward the most valuable work and projects within the ecosystem. Seven rounds spread over 12+ weeks are allocating a $75k reward pool, and each round’s results populate the [FVM Builders Leaderboard](http://spacewarp.fvm.dev/#ie), showcasing leading projects to the ecosystem. Learn more about Impact Evaluators for FVM, the Builders Leaderboard, and how you can get involved in this blog post.

### **Boost Monitoring Stack**

Since the initial release of [Boost](https://boost.filecoin.io/) in mid June 2022, we have seen a significant increase in the number of storage providers migrating to use Boost to manage storage deals. With the introduction of new ecosystem projects and programs, there is a high demand for additional storage and retrieval options from Filecoin. Based on feedback from the ecosystem, we have added booster-http and booster-bitswap, which enables storage providers to directly serve content to retrieval clients over additional data transfer protocols. Learn more in [this blog post](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/boost-monitoring-stack/).
