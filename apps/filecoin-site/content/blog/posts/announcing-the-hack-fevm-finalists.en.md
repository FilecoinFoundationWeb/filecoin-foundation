## Soulmates

**ETHGlobal Finalist  
Filecoin - Grand Prize**

![](/uploads/soulmatessbt.webp)

Soulmates is a [soulbound token](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/soulmates-wveqg) (SBT) issuance engine built on FEVM. It includes a set of FEVM smart contracts, specifically 17 files, 11 test files, and around 500 lines of solidity code. It’s a fully-featured and fully-functioning frontend dapp that can be used to “create, assign, and claim SBTs.”

Soulmates can support lending protocols, DeFi solutions, storage provider reputation systems, and education credentials.

## Koios

**ETHGlobal Finalist  
Filecoin - Runner Up**

![](/uploads/koiosdatadao.webp)

Koios is a [no-code Data DAO platform](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/koios-adm6x) where anyone can launch, manage, and upgrade data DAOs that can enable data publishers, algorithm developers, and consumers to manage and use datasets. Anyone can create a DAO from an NFT or token and manage that DAO by allowing members to participate in things like staking, proposing, investment vaults, NFT galleries, and voting.

DAOs on the Koios platform enables real life gated utility. Members of a created DAO can get access to the databases that the DAO develops through the Data DAO interface. New algorithms are published as Data NFTs, and the publisher can create Data tokens to allow any member of the Data DAO to purchase that algorithm.

## DataMarket

**ETHGlobal Finalist  
Pool Prize**

![](/uploads/datamarket.webp)

Decentralized exchanges open peer-to-peer marketplaces where crypto traders can make transactions without passing funds through an intermediary contact. While data exchange platforms already exist, most require long-term commitments or require traders to work through a third party with added fees.

DataMarket is a self-governing, open blockchain platform that allows anyone to create [data purchase or checkout pages](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/datamarket-instant-data-purchase-pages-zz5z0) on the FEVM network. According to the project’s description, “if a bad or inaccurate dataset is uploaded and sold, a purchaser or potential purchaser can flag the dataset as being fraudulent.”

## ZKsig NFTs

**ETHGlobal Finalist  
Pool Prize**

![](/uploads/zksignfts.webp)ZKsig NFTs introduced a marketplace delegated authorization that uses [NFTs and legally binding agreements](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/zksig-nfts-j597n). The team used the FEVM to create ERC-721 NFTs from legally binding agreements such as DocuSign on the blockchain. There are four delegated authorization contracts for marketplace deal proposals which use NFTs to gate access.

## Catalog DAO

**ETHGlobal Finalist  
Filecoin - Data DAO**

![](/uploads/catalogdao.webp)Catalog is a [dMRV Data DAO](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/catalogdao-r53w3) that introduces an incentivized network of regeneration advocates, storage providers, and researchers that work together to support local carbon projects. Catalog aims to allow carbon project developers to procure, store, analyze, and self-govern data with an incentivized dMRV platform.

DAO members can procure high-quality data, research resources, and open computing over data to support carbon projects. The DAO can also use voting to distribute rewards for activities such as providing and storing data, updating the ecological state of a specific project, and running computing jobs.

## SolShare Wallet

**ETHGlobal Finalist**  
![](/uploads/solshare.webp)SolShare Wallet allows anyone to [configure a double authentication factor](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/solshare-wallet-swjjq) (2FA) with two different wallets. This increases the security of transactions and helps defend assets from possible attacks. In the event that one wallet is lost, access will be denied to prevent issues like theft. Additional features include a wallet specifically for hackathons, where each member can register a wallet, and can only withdraw awards after obtaining approval from the team.

## SPN DAO

**ETHGlobal Finalist  
Filecoin - Runner Up**

![](/uploads/spndao.webp)SPN is a data DAO that empowers consumers to turn [credit card transaction data into assets](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/spn-dao-zwbar), which unlocks true data ownership. Consumers have limited control over the way their credit card transaction data is used, which means they don’t receive anything in return when their data is used. In addition, there’s no marketplace where consumers can coordinate and pool data together.

SPN DAO unlocks this ability through a dapp on the FEVM chain that facilitates the creation and operation of a Data DAO.

## CredLancer

**ETHGlobal Finalist**

![](/uploads/credlancer4.webp)CredLancer is an [on-chain credentialing and collaboration platform](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/credlancer-credentialed-freelancer-protocol-znzpf) for organizations and freelancers. Organizations and DAOs can unlock team member verification, role badging, and project completion incentives. For example, game developers can highlight their expertise, bid for projects, and connect with other professionals in the industry.

The CredLancer platform aims to fix the lack of communication and collaboration between game developers by allowing the community to work together to complete projects that are showcased by verified on-chain credentials.

## FIL-Peggy

**ETHGlobal Finalist  
Pool Prize**

![](/uploads/fil-peggy.webp)FIL-Peggy is a [playground and lending smart contract](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/fil-peggy-f77i2) based on FVM. It can manage miners, accept deposits from users for collateral, and distribute rewards. This offers a brand new set of tools to simplify the process of running nodes, owning accounts, and earning rewards.

Rewards are based on the amount ratios attached to specific deposits, and thanks to the introduction of a self-governing process, this bypasses ownership through private keys that can create a power imbalance between owners.

## Web3VitePress

**Pool Prize**

![](/uploads/web3vitepress.webp)

VitePress is a [static site generator that now works with FVM and IPFS](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/web3vitepress-43gs7). It deploys an NFT contract onto FVM, while the content created on VitePress is stored on IPFS. The new capabilities will help content creators produce things like blogs and articles into the Web3 space by using Markdown.

## Peerio

**Pool Prize**

![](/uploads/peerio.webp)

Peerio is a [DeSci application that allows users to submit scholarly articles](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/peerio-0bv55) that must be peer reviewed as a form of consensus. Common problems that plague the current peer review process include plagiarism, limited review groups, and content duplication. Peerio plans to solve these issues by adding details like reputation, incentives such as FIL token awards, and promote quality work by allowing peer reviewers to win or lose reputation based on review accuracy.

## FILAfrique

**Pool Prize**

![](/uploads/filafrique.webp)

FILAfrique provides [FIL-backed Stablecoins and a decentralized exchange](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/filafrique-mneya) for African currencies. The project hopes to boost intercontinental trade and the use of DeFi products in the region by allowing users to swap FIL tokens for local currency Stablecoins.

## Investorage

**Pool Prize**

![](/uploads/investorage-edited.webp)

Investorage aims to allow users to [stake an amount of tokens in a pool](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/investorage-gobv4) and not only gain interest, but a subscription of their choice as well. Users can select a specific subscription which requires them to stake a certain amount of tokens. Once staked, the tokens are immediately placed in the pool where they accumulate interest.

## FAFU

**Pool Prize**

![](/uploads/fafu.webp)

FAFU (Files Are Forever Urs) is a [Gnosis SAFE App for safe DAO and multisig file storage](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/fafu-files-are-forever-urs-gnosis-safe-oz4vb). FAFU allows users to save community files on any chain through a storage deal on the fly. The project combines a Gnosis DAO starter UI and FEVM and allows multisig and Zodiac DAO actors to save files in the Filecoin decentralized system.

## FEVM DataDAO Boilerplate

**Pool Prize**

![](/uploads/datadaoboilerplate.webp)

The FEVM DataDAO Boilerplate project aims to [help developers and DAOs to quickstart governance](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/fevm-datadao-boilerplate-9majy) on Wallaby and later on FEVM. Different kits are mixed to create a smooth way to launch a completely on-chain governed DataDAO. Next steps include a Factory Contract wrapper and a frontend to open accessibility for non-developers.

## Deal-Lock

**Pool Prize**

![](/uploads/deallock.webp)

Deal-Lock provides an efficient way to [time lock storage deals](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/deal-lock-ob00d) on storage providers in the Filecoin network. The project will allow users to store and retrieve data from the Filecoin network through deals. Miners and clients interact with each other through storage and retrieval deals. The dapp will pull out variables of any deal once the time lock expires.

## poLateral

**Filecoin - DeFi**

![](/uploads/polateral.webp)

poLateral is an [FEVM-based open-source liquidity protocol](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/polateral-88ipp) to provide Filecoin collaterals as a loan for storage providers. Liquidity providers can supply FIL assets and storage providers can borrow a designated amount based on pledging and collateral requirements. Storage providers often face hurdles stemming from the need for collateral pledges. Issues like insufficient initial capital in hand or high translation costs can intimidate storage providers and negatively impact long-term growth for the Filecoin network.

The bonding bridge poLateral provides will introduce communication between the storage provider and liquidity protocol to reduce collateral barriers.

## MinerDealer

**Filecoin - DeFi**

![](/uploads/minerdealer.webp)

MinerDealer is a [protocol that helps increase storage](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/minerdealer-wmkqj) in Filecoin, encouraging miners to have liquidity to operate within the network. This will allow miners to fulfill obligations which helps create a better reputation. The process is based on a loan design, allowing storage actors within FVM to check the reputation of miners so lenders can deposit tokens without needing collateral.

## PODP - Proof of Data Preservation

**Filecoin - Data DAO**

![](/uploads/podp.webp)

Proof of Data Preservation (PODP) [mints dynamic SBTs](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/podp-proof-of-data-preservation-57v6u) based on the Filecoin preservation status. The SBT proves that someone is a legitimate data preserver in the community. With PODP, users can claim SBTs for proof of data preservation by checking the deal status in the Filecoin network. While a lot of NFT data management uses IPFS, the content could disappear as time passes. PODP hopes to solve this problem by introducing an incentive to preserve NFT-related data for community members.

## Anc3stree

**Filecoin - Data DAO**

![](/uploads/anc3stree.webp)

Anc3stree is a Data DAO that provides [permanent storage of family trees](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/anc3stree-7a6y8) by utilizing smart contracts and Filecoin storage. Anyone can use Anc3stree to build a family tree and keep a record of family relations. Decentralization and wide blockchain accessibility unlocks perpetual family tree storage for generations.

## FNS: Filecoin Naming Service

**Filecoin - Infra**

![](/uploads/fns.webp)

The Filecoin Naming Service (FNS) is a [decentralized name service](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/fns-filecoin-naming-service-czomc) based on the Filecoin EVM. It resolves metadata into easy-to-read xxx.fil names. Each FNS domain is treated as an NFT, and the FNS contract complies with the interfaces of the ERC-721 standard. The NFT can be transferred and traded on secondary markets.

In addition, owners can configure domain names for their miners. The Miner Domains Service (MDS) allows users to use the Filfox browser to search for a specific domain for a corresponding miner.
