The Filecoin ecosystem is entering a new era of community-led public goods funding with the launch of the ProPGF program. At the heart of this prototype initiative is the Selection Committee—a diverse, expert-driven group designed to ensure that funding decisions reflect the needs, values, and priorities of the Filecoin community.

What Is the Selection Committee?

The Selection Committee is a \~12 member body tasked with advising, supporting, and lending subject matter expertise to the ProPGF program throughout its prototype phase in 2025. Overseen and funded by the Protocol Labs Filecoin Foundation (PLFIF), the committee will play a pivotal role in reviewing project proposals, guiding funding decisions, and shaping the future of public goods in the Filecoin ecosystem.

## Selection Committee Strategy

Expertise-Driven, Community-Focused

- The committee is composed of individuals with deep knowledge of the crypto landscape, public goods, and non-dilutive capital allocation.
- Members bring technical expertise in decentralized storage, go-to-market strategy, community engagement, and open-source project management.
- The committee operates with a commitment to transparency, leveraging on-chain tools like Snapshot for voting and Questbook for grant management, ensuring all decisions are visible and auditable by the community.

Diversity and Representation

- The committee is intentionally balanced to represent a range of perspectives, stakeholder groups, and professional backgrounds from across the Filecoin and broader crypto ecosystem.
- Geographic and cultural diversity are prioritized to ensure a holistic approach to public goods funding.

Independence and Integrity

- Members are selected for their ability to provide unbiased, objective judgments.
- Strict conflict-of-interest policies are enforced: committee members must disclose potential conflicts and abstain from voting where personal interests are involved.

Commitment and Incentives

- Committee members are incentivized with FIL token compensation to ensure active participation throughout each funding batch.
- The committee is in place during batches 1 & 2 of ProPGF then will be disbanded to allow for a new committee to form in 2026 with learnings from the prototype phase.

## Committee Recruitment

Recruitment Process

- Candidates were identified through outreach to respected members of the Filecoin ecosystem, with input from community leaders and stack leads.
- The opportunity was announced publicly with an openly available interest form. Candidates are evaluated based on expertise, experience, and alignment with the committee’s values.
- Final selection is based on qualifications and the need for a balanced, representative committee.

## Looking Ahead

The ProPGF Selection Committee is foundational to building a transparent, community-driven funding model for public goods in the Filecoin ecosystem. We will be announcing the committee in a follow-up post early next week – please stay tuned!
