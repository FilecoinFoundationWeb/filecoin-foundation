### Filecoin Network v16 Skyr

The v16 network upgrade, codenamed Skyr, happened today, Wednesday, July 6th at 1400 UTC! This upgrade transitioned the Filecoin network to running its core logic on the Wasm-based [Filecoin Virtual Machine](https://fvm.filecoin.io/). This upgrade represents the most dramatic transformation of the Filecoin network since its inception nearly two years ago, and is the first step towards unlocking user programmability on Filecoin. Stay tuned for more updates on the upgrade on the [Filecoin Twitter](https://twitter.com/Filecoin) and [Filecoin blog](http://filecoin.io/blog) later this week.

### How to Become a Green Storage Provider

The Filecoin Network is on its way to becoming carbon neutral at the node level thanks to initiatives fostered by [Filecoin Green](https://green.filecoin.io/). Of course, all these efforts start with Filecoin Storage Providers (SPs). The cryptographic primitives used in the Filecoin Network can also be applied to their operations to measure and, ultimately, make them more sustainable in verifiable ways. Visit the [Filecoin blog](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/how-to-become-a-green-storage-provider/) if you’d like to get started on your journey to become a green SP.

### Lighthouse Makes Permanent Storage on Filecoin Easy and Affordable

Lighthouse is a facilitator of permanent file storage on the Filecoin Network where users only pay once and their files are stored forever. Traditionally, users need to keep track and pay for their files after a fixed amount of time. Lighthouse manages this for them by moving from a rent-based cost model to a permanent ownership model. [Read along](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/lighthouse-makes-permanent-storage-on-filecoin-easy-and-affordable/) to find out more about how it works and how it uses Filecoin and IPFS.
