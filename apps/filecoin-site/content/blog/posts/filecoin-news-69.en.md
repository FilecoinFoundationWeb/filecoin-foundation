### FVM Builder Cohort Launches to Mainnet

Leading up to FVM launch, 60+ projects in the Filecoin ecosystem were already building with FVM on its Hyperspace testnet as a part of the FVM Mainnet Pioneers cohort, a 6-week program that provided technical, product, and business mentorship and resources to selected teams. The cohort recently graduated with a showcase of the projects and a successful pitch day demonstrating the numerous opportunities that the FVM unlocks, such as liquid leasing, dataDAOs, decentralized computation frameworks, and more. Learn more about each of these teams and what the community is building with FVM in [this blog post](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/filecoin-virtual-machine-fvm-builder-cohort-launches-to-mainnet/). And lastly, congratulations to the graduated teams!

### Case Study: DeSci Labs

The “Replication Crisis,” the notion that results reported in scientific papers are difficult reproduce and independently verify by other researchers, is a challenge for the scientific community. By embracing open science principles and leveraging decentralized web technologies such as Filecoin and IPFS, the scientific community can overcome the challenges posed by the lack of transparency and reproducibility. These tools are the foundation of DeSci Labs’ vision for creating an open-access network without paywalls, barriers, and vendor lock-in. Read more about DeSci Labs in Filecoin Foundation's latest [case study](https://fil-foundation.on.fleek.co/hosting/FF-CaseStudy-DeSci.pdf). 

### Introducing drand Code Walkthroughs 

The [drand](https://drand.love/) community and developer base is expanding rapidly. drand usage is gaining momentum with many applications using it to draw randomness for their systems. With that in mind, the team is launching code walkthroughs for community members who want to gain a holistic view of the system, become familiar with nitty gritty details, and ask questions in real time. These will be split in 8 sessions, starting on Tuesday June 20th at 1430 UTC and running every other Tuesday. Read the [blogpost](https://drand.love/blog/2023/06/06/announcing-the-drand-code-walkthroughs/) for more details.
