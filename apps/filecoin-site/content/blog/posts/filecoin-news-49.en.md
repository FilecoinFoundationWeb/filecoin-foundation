### Join the FEVM Early Builders Program

The FVM was recently [introduced](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/filecoin-v16-network-upgrade-skyr/) to enable users to deploy their own smart contracts and unlock the ability to perform on-chain computation over state data. The next major milestone will be the release of a fully EVM-compatible Filecoin Virtual Machine (FEVM). The community is looking for skilled Solidity developers that want to deploy some of the first use cases and smart contracts on the Filecoin network, to be part of our FEVM Early Builders Program. Stay tuned and find out more about FVM on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Filecoin/status/1527731630156177410?s=20&t=DEFL2Vnt9U8bNzn3w-5Ptw), watch the YouTube [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_0VrY55uV18DBdFIkN0jdBMF8nadVxWQ), or join the dedicated Slack [channel](https://filecoinproject.slack.com/) #fvm

### Filecoin Green on the SXSW 2023 Panel Picker

Support the [Filecoin Green](https://green.filecoin.io/) community by [voting](https://panelpicker.sxsw.com/vote/128291) for Alan Ransil’s talk “Renewable NFTs: Verifiable, Opaque, and Granular” to be part of SXSW 2023. He’ll be sharing all the ways in which NFTs can be a tool to measure and encourage the use of renewable energy sources across the space, from verifiability to enabling more granular approaches in the reduction of carbon emissions. The voting process is still open on the [SXSW website](https://panelpicker.sxsw.com/vote/128291).

### ESPA Bootcamp: Innovation in Storage

Storage technology has evolved rapidly over the past 30 years at a rate that even industry veterans did not expect. At the ESPA Bootcamp, Seagate’s Lance Blumberg presented the EXOS Corvault and E 4U106 as ideal solutions for SPs looking for cost-effective building blocks for their operations. The 18TB/20TB HDDs feature Filecoin-specific optimizations such as performance maximization, easy scalability, simple setup, and no software vendor lock-in. Read the recap of his presentation on the [Filecoin blog](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/espa-bootcamp-innovation-in-storage/).

### Off-Chain Doesn’t Mean Centralized for NFT.Storage

Jonathan Victor addressed the common misconception that off-chain storage means centralized storage in a recent interview with CoinTelegraph. Decentralized storage solutions do exist and they solve the issue of blockchain networks’ typically limited storage power. Check out his [explanation](https://cointelegraph.com/news/nonfungible-tokens-don-t-live-on-the-blockchain-experts-say) on how [NFT.Storage](https://nft.storage/) can rely on Filecoin and IPFS to store objects such as NFT metadata as a public good.
