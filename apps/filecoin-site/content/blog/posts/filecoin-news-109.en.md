## ✨ Highlights ✨

### 🔥 PDP Launches on Mainnet: Verifiable Hot Storage Comes to Filecoin

Filecoin has entered a new era of decentralized storage with the launch of Proof of Data Possession (PDP) on mainnet—unlocking fast, verifiable access to hot data. Unlike traditional cold storage proofs, PDP enables storage providers to cryptographically prove they hold immediately available files, without needing to retrieve or unseal them. This upgrade bridges the performance gap between centralized clouds and decentralized storage, empowering use cases like AI training, static web content delivery, and developer environments. With PDP, builders gain the speed they need, clients get peace of mind their data is ready on demand, and SPs can tap into new revenue opportunities. The [SPX onboarding program](https://filoznotebook.notion.site/SPX-Program-PDP-Edition-1e6dc41950c180bc89f6fc252e7e036d) kicks off this May to help scale PDP adoption across the network.

### 💵 USDFC Goes Public: High-Yield Stablecoin Minting Now Open to All

After months of testing, USDFC, the first stablecoin collateralized by native FIL, is officially launching to the public today at FIL Dev Summit 6. Built with a 110% collateral ratio and protected by a 24/7 arbitrage bot, USDFC offers a rock-solid peg and real utility: swap via SushiSwap, pay for storage with Lighthouse, and mint or redeem FIL with no slippage. With APRs ranging from 8–10%, cross-chain compatibility via Axelar, and lending support through iFIL and pFIL, USDFC brings seamless, on-chain USD liquidity to the Filecoin ecosystem for the first time.

### 🔗 Lighthouse Goes Live on Base with Filecoin Storage + Stablecoins

Lighthouse has officially launched on Base, enabling seamless access to Filecoin storage using stablecoins like USDC and USDT. Powered by Axelar, this integration brings cross-chain compatibility to the forefront—allowing developers to tap into encrypted, decentralized storage on Filecoin from within the Base ecosystem. It’s a major step toward a more composable, multi-chain future for Web3 data infrastructure. [Get started!](https://files.lighthouse.storage/)

### 🧠 Storacha MCP: Decentralized Memory for AI Agents

As AI agents generate more data than ever, Storacha’s new MCP Storage Server delivers the missing link: a standardized, decentralized storage interface purpose-built for AI. Using the Model Context Protocol (MCP), agents can now upload, retrieve, and verify files using IPFS and Filecoin—no custom APIs or centralized dependencies needed. Powered by CIDs, UCANs, and trustless audits, Storacha provides persistent, self-sovereign memory for models like Claude and ElizaOS. It’s storage built for autonomy, interoperability, and speed. Devs can get started with SDKs, sample configs, and free storage—just plug in and go.

### 🔍 Exploring Retrievability on Filecoin

As web3 matures, fast and reliable data access becomes just as crucial as storage. This [new guide from FilOz](https://filoznotebook.notion.site/A-Guide-to-Retrievability-on-Filecoin-18bdc41950c18058a555ef6f5bec2dd8) dives into the state of retrievability on Filecoin—unpacking the protocols, challenges, and payment models that shape how users retrieve stored data. From simple retrievals to advanced, CDN-style integrations like retriev.org, the guide outlines strategies clients can use based on speed, reliability, and cost needs. It also highlights modular payment structures, evolving SP/client selection mechanisms, and key performance metrics. As the network grows, a flexible, trust-minimized approach to retrievability will be vital to ensuring a seamless experience for users and developers alike.
