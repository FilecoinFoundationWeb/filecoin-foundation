## Announcements

### Filecoin docs is moving to Gitbook 

The Protocol Labs Docs Team is transitioning from Hugo, Doks, and Fleek to GitBook for hosting the Filecoin Docs website. This move aims to provide a more user-friendly experience for both contributors and readers, offering streamlined collaboration, version control, and customization options. GitBook also introduces AI-powered search features, making information retrieval faster and more efficient. Contributors can suggest edits using GitBook's user-friendly editor, ensuring accessibility, while the content remains the same, resulting in a smoother user experience with improved search functionality.

### Get ready for LabWeek23 in Istanbul

[Lab Week](http://23.labweek.io/) is back! Last year, more than 1,500 builders gathered in Lisbon, Portugal, for the first-ever decentralized conference organized by the Protocol Labs Network. Focused on shaping the future of the internet, LabWeek23 will bring the community together again November 13-17, 2023 in Istanbul, Turkey, alongside Devconnect. Get ready for a packed program that will cover ZK proofs, decentralized storage, AI and blockchain, compute over data, decentralized identity, cryptoeconomics, DeSci, and much more. We look forward to seeing you in Istanbul!

### Decentralized Compute: What it unlocks and why it matters

Why is compute over data (CoD) central to the Filecoin master plan? Enterprise data is growing 42% YoY yet moving data is still relatively slow and expensive. We need decentralized open source compute over data protocols to efficiently process data at the source rather than moving data. Learn more about what decentralized compute unlocks in the latest [FilecoinTLDR blog](https://filecointldr.io/article/decentralized-compute-what-it-unlocks-and-why-it-matters-now).
