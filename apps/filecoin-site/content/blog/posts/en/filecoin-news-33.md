## Announcements

[![](/uploads/144449134-38e41c06-9fb8-4b02-9f96-20f0c571cd67.webp)](https://medium.com/@filecoingreen/introducing-the-filecoin-energy-dashboard-46d2cbe14d39)

### Introducing the Filecoin Energy Dashboard

There’s been a lot of talk around the environmental impact of Proof-of-Work blockchains and too little about the important solutions Web3 can bring to the table. Filecoin Green is excited to launch an open-source [dashboard](https://filecoin.energy/) that tracks the energy consumption of its storage providers. The tool gives them, and potentially miners from other networks, a decentralized way to purchase Renewable Energy Certificates and store them in [Filrep](https://filrep.io/?columns=energy&order=desc&sortBy=energy).

The project was developed as a [collaboration](https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/protocol-labs-and-energy-web-complete-first-showcase-of-an-open-source-solution-to-decarbonize-1a8c22ac02f5) between Protocol Labs and fellow Crypto Climate Accord co-signer Energy Web Zero in an effort to make the network carbon neutral, and in the future, net carbon negative. As an open-source tool, it could easily be extended to Bitcoin miners and [help](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/12/02/filecoin-might-have-a-way-for-bitcoin-to-fight-its-energy-critics-if-miners-use-it/) ward off some of the heavy criticism the network has received over its energy consumption. To learn more about Filecoin Green, [check out this blog post](https://medium.com/@filecoingreen/introducing-the-filecoin-energy-dashboard-46d2cbe14d39) and to get involved, join the #fil-green channel on [Filecoin slack](http://filecoin.io/slack).

### Now launching: the Filecoin Community Roadmap

The Filecoin community roadmap will be a publicly managed tool that is updated on a quarterly basis. The purpose is to provide a simple, accessible, and reliable product for understanding what's being worked on, by whom, and when it will be made available. Project contributions are now being accepted through the end of December. [Learn more and share your project](https://github.com/filecoin-project/community/discussions/399).

### Announcing the winners of the 2021 Filecoin Auction Challenge with Textile

For the Filecoin network’s one-year anniversary, the community decided to test the throughput of storage providers over a two-week period and the results were astounding. 90 TiB were stored during the Auction Challenge with the help of 25 storage providers. The top contributors were:

- [f01208862](https://filfox.info/en/address/f01208862): 9,500 GiB
- [f022142](https://filfox.info/en/address/f022142): 6,900 GiB
- [f010088](https://filfox.info/en/address/f010088)**: 2,400 GiB**

### SnapDeals External Audit Complete

The Filecoin network recently announced [SnapDeals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIYfKlt2NhE&list=PL_0VrY55uV1_HE_bE-frkYUPGybjYHbNz&index=36), a new extension to the protocol that will unlock 99% of the network’s 12 EiB capacity for data storage that currently stands in Committed Capacity sectors. SnapDeals are a lightweight way of updating these sectors with client data as opposed to the high-latency process required in the current implementation. An external [audit](https://github.com/filecoin-project/rust-fil-proofs/blob/06d2078a2c6af0886cb843cef2cc3fd474c74be7/audits/protocollabs-report-20211210.pdf) for SnapDeals was recently conducted ahead of a Q1 2022 launch.
