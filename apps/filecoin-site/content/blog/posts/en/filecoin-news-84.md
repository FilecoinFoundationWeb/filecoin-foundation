## ‚ú® Highlights ‚ú®

### InterPlanetary Consensus & Fluence Power the Future of Cloudless Computing

[InterPlanetary Consensus (IPC)](http://ipc.space/) and [Fluence](https://fluence.network/) are excited to announce the upcoming IPC-powered Fluence Network launch of its decentralized serverless computing platform, which will offer cheaper, provable, and truly decentralized computing for web3 builders. This collaboration aligns with Fluence's vision for an open computing platform, leveraging IPC's decentralized scaling technology for web3 applications. The Fluence platform enables developers to build faster, secure applications, and promote transparent AI solutions, free from centralized control. The collaboration underscores a significant shift towards a cloudless economy, emphasizing user empowerment, scalability, and efficiency in decentralized services.

### Uniswap V3 Launches on FVM with Axelar Bridged Assets

Following approval of the Uniswap governance proposal in October 2023, Uniswap v3 has been deployed on the Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM), with trading now live on OKU.trade. This development is further enhanced by the integration with Axelar Network, which facilitates the use of bridged USDC and ETH directly on Filecoin. This advancement enables developers to leverage these assets within the Filecoin ecosystem, marking a significant milestone in the FVM's expansion and utility for DeFi applications.
