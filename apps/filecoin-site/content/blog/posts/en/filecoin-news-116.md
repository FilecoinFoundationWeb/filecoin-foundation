[Dive deeper](https://akave.com/blog/preserving-independent-journalism-the-defiant-secures-its-archives-with-akave-cloud-filecoin). 

### 🌌 Storing the Cosmos with Filecoin and RAMO

A new [blog post from Filecoin Foundation](https://fil.org/blog/unlocking-the-cosmos-how-cornell-astrophysicist-uses-ramo-to-store-the-universe-on-filecoin) highlights how a Cornell astrophysicist is leveraging RAMO to store astronomical datasets on Filecoin. By preserving observations from the universe on decentralized infrastructure, this collaboration ensures long-term access and integrity for the scientific community. A literal case of Filecoin reaching for the stars.
