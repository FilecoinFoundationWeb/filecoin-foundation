### Fast Finality (F3): A Transformative Leap for Filecoin

The [Fast Finality (F3) upgrade](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0086.md) is set to revolutionize Filecoin's consensus layer, reducing finality times from 900 epochs to just 2. This breakthrough enhances transaction speed, improves cross-chain operations, streamlines storage provider onboarding, and enables more efficient light clients. After rigorous testing and adjustments, F3 is nearing its mainnet launch with the upcoming NV25 upgrade, starting with Calibration in December and full activation on Mainnet by January 2025. The community can track progress through dedicated dashboards and contribute to testing via Slack.
