The Protocol Labs Docs Team has been using a combination of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), [Doks](https://getdoks.org/), and [Fleek](https://fleek.co/) to create and host the Filecoin Docs website. While these services and platforms have served us well, we've decided to move the docs to the [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/) platform.

One of the main reasons for this change is that GitBook provides a more streamlined and user-friendly experience for both contributors and readers of the documentation. The platform allows for easy collaboration and version control, making it easier for the team to manage and update the documentation over time. Additionally, GitBook offers a range of customization options that will allow the team to create a more visually appealing and engaging documentation experience for users.

GitBook has recently introduced new search features powered by AI that make finding information easier than ever. With the new search engine, users can quickly search for specific keywords or phrases within a document, and the AI will provide relevant results in seconds. The AI-powered search feature can also help users discover related content they may have missed, making it a valuable tool for researchers, writers, and knowledge workers.

Contributing to Filecoin Docs is now easier and more accessible. The content for Filecoin Docs still lives at [github.com/filecoin-project/filecoin-docs](https://github.com/filecoin-project/filecoin-docs), and PRs are still welcome there. On top of that, contributors can suggest edits using GitBook's what-you-see-is-what-you-get editor. This editor eliminates contribution barriers for folks unfamiliar with Markdown or Git, who can now contribute directly from the browser using a familiar word processing experience.

It's important to note that all the content within the Filecoin docs site stays the same; this means no broken links or 404s! The only changes affecting you, the user, are how the site looks, and what you can now do with search. Everything else remains the same.

Thanks for reading! We'll see you in the docs!
