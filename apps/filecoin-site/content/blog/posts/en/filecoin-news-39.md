### Why Become a Filecoin Storage Provider

As the need for file storage continues to grow and enterprises warm up to the advantages of decentralized Web3-native solutions, the addressable market for the independent service providers who choose the decentralized route is becoming increasingly fertile. There are concrete advantages for service providers who join Filecoin and embrace the transition from cloud storage to decentralized storage. [Read along](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/why-become-a-filecoin-storage-provider/) and find out what they are.

### Starboard Reports Significant Growth on Filecoin

Web3 data analytics provider [Starboard](https://www.starboard.ventures/) reports a major milestone for the Filecoin Network. The network’s revenue has seen rapid growth and supply and demand are both going up. Daily New Storage Deals reached over 1 PiB/day, the equivalent 562,949 2GB accounts on Web 2.0 storage services. This suggests strong Filecoin adoption globally. Read the details on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Starboard_V/status/1508464845288484873).

### Cryptography is Going to Space with Protocol Labs and Cryptostat

Stanford PhDs at Cryptostat are in collaboration with the community to launch a new time-based cryptographic primitive known as the Verifiable Delay Function (VFD) powered by unique satellite properties. The technology is based on Bernardo David and Carsten Baum’s work and will experiment with how the physical properties of communication with satellites can benefit time-based cryptographic primitive designs, and provide lower bounds on the delay guaranteed by such constructions.
