### NFT.Storage powered by IPFS and Filecoin crosses 50M uploads

NFT.Storage has crossed 50 million user uploads to the service! It's a huge milestone that shows both the overall growth of the NFT space, as well as increased awareness within the space of the importance of securely handling off-chain NFT data. The NFT ecosystem is increasingly seeing the importance of making references off-chain data [content addressed](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/content-addressing/) and ensuring this data is always accessible on IPFS via these content addresses with NFT.Storage as one perpetual storage option with long-term provable storage via Filecoin.

### Why Become a Filecoin Storage Provider?

As the need for file storage continues to grow and enterprises warm up to the advantages of decentralized Web3-native solutions, the addressable market for the independent service providers who choose the decentralized route is becoming increasingly fertile. There are concrete advantages for service providers who join Filecoin and embrace the transition from cloud storage to decentralized storage. [Read along](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/why-become-a-filecoin-storage-provider/) and find out what they are.

### **Cryptography is Going to Space with Protocol Labs and Cryptostat**

Stanford PhDs at Cryptostat are in collaboration with the community to launch a new time-based cryptographic primitive known as the Verifiable Delay Function (VFD) powered by unique satellite properties. The technology is based on Bernardo David and Carsten Baum’s work and will experiment with how the physical properties of communication with satellites can benefit time-based cryptographic primitive designs, and provide lower bounds on the delay guaranteed by such constructions.
