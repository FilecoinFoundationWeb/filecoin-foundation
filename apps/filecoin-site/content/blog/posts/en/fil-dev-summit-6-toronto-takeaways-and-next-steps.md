The client success track focused on the practical challenges and strategies for driving real-world adoption of Filecoin storage, especially among enterprise clients. Participants explored client-centric growth, Ideal Customer Profiles (ICPs), improved onboarding tools, driving real-world adoption of Filecoin, and laying the groundwork for scalable demand. Participants also explored how onramps—tools and processes that help clients bring their data onto Filecoin—can be continuously tested and improved, and how feedback loops from these efforts can drive better product-market fit and client satisfaction.

### Takeaways

- Winning enterprise clients requires tailored messaging and a deep understanding of their procurement processes, with a focus on meeting compliance and legal standards rather than just technical features.
- Customer service is a strategic lever—not just a cost center—and is critical for building trust and driving adoption, especially as Filecoin moves upmarket.
- Firsthand onboarding experiences (like those with data.gov and Eastore.xyz) reveal both friction points and opportunities for improvement, underscoring the importance of “dogfooding” and open feedback.
- Continuous iteration of onramps and documentation is necessary to reduce barriers for new clients and to scale demand effectively.

### Next Steps

- Continue hands-on testing of onramps using open datasets to surface and address onboarding challenges.
- Record and report onramp usage data onchain to improve transparency and measure progress.
- Pursue initiatives to make internal knowledge resources (like Slack channels and documentation) more accessible and unified, reducing information silos and supporting the broader ecosystem.

## The Onchain Tech Stack: Unlocking Filecoin’s Smart Data Economy

The onchain tech stack track explored Filecoin’s onchain infrastructure and the frameworks powering verifiable, programmable services. The spotlight was on the Filecoin Web Services (FWS) framework — a working name for a marketplace of DePIN services that brings together Proof of Data Possession (PDP), stablecoin payments, and composable cloud primitives. While the final naming is still under consideration, the vision is already taking shape: a platform for decentralized infrastructure services.

### Takeaways

- On-chain paid deal growth is a shared priority. The network is aligned on proving out Filecoin's utility by facilitating and tracking real-world, on-chain deals.
- FWS is maturing into a programmable layer. With a near-term engineering path to unlock stablecoin-based, real-time payments, FWS is becoming a platform for composable storage and compute services.
- Demand from other ecosystems. Projects from Solana and beyond are eager to integrate with Filecoin for storage-heavy use cases like digital assets, decentralized indexing, and DePIN.
- Trust through verifiability. With tools like Merkle inclusion proofs and PDP, Filecoin is working toward more auditable data retrieval and storage guarantees.

### Next Steps

- Developing FWS with deal intent specifications, exploring cross-chain data bridges, and developing early builder programs.
- Spend more time with AI Agents to empower them to work on Filecoin tech.
- Design and prototype experimental FIL+ allocators, rewards pool, and more.

## Tools & Builders: Supercharging Innovation in the Filecoin Ecosystem

The Tools & Builders track highlighted the ongoing efforts to empower developers and accelerate innovation across the Filecoin ecosystem. This session focused on the importance of robust tooling, clear documentation, and reliable infrastructure to support both new and existing builders.
