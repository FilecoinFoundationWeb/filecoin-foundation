**_UPDATE: FIL-Singapore has been postponed._**

In light of the ongoing COVID-19 disruption and continued travel restrictions across Asia Pacific, we are postponing FIL Singapore to late September to ensure we meet the event’s high expectations, which we share with our valued community. The event will now take place September 26-27, at the Marina Bay Sands in Singapore, ahead of TOKEN2049. We understand this change is disruptive for our community members who have made plans to attend the event. Thank you for your flexibility and support. We look forward to seeing you later this year!
