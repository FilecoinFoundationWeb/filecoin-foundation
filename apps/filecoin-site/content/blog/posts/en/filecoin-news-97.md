## ‚ú® Highlights ‚ú®

### Fast Finality is coming to Filecoin in nv24

[The Tuk Tuk üõ∫ network upgrade](https://github.com/filecoin-project/community/discussions/74#discussioncomment-10807265) is coming, bringing exciting enhancements to Filecoin! This upgrade introduces fast finality, reducing transaction finality from 7.5 hours to just seconds. It also sets a lower bound for sector initial pledges to ensure robust network security. Additionally, it adds the MCOPY opcode to support the latest Solidity contracts and a precompile to fetch beacon digests from chain history, providing reliable randomness for smart contracts. [Read more about the upgrade](https://github.com/filecoin-project/community/discussions/74#discussioncomment-10807265) coming soon.¬†
