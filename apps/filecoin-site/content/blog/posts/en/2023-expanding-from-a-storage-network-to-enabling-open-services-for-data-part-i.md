These developments not only expand the capabilities of FVM but also create new frontiers for creativity and technological advancements within the Filecoin ecosystem.

### DeFi

The launch of the FVM marked a pivotal moment, giving rise to the flourishing domain of decentralized finance (DeFi) on the Filecoin Network. The inception of Filecoin DeFi has proven to be a game-changer, introducing innovative ways to connect Storage Providers with additional opportunities to utilize FIL as collateral, facilitating the seamless onboarding of capacity and storage to the Filecoin Network. Over the span of just 9 months, the Filecoin Network has witnessed an impressive accumulation of more than 20 million FIL tokens, strategically deposited across 10 distinct Filecoin DeFi services.

The Filecoin DeFi ecosystem, including notable platforms such as Glif, stFIL, SFT Protocol, HashKing, FilFi, Filet Finance, MineFi, HashMix, mFIL DAO, and CollectifDAO, has garnered substantial traction. The cumulative value locked (TVL) in the Filecoin Network has surged, surpassing 280 million USD. This meteoric rise has propelled Filecoin to the #25 spot on DeFi Llama's prestigious ranking of top chains by TVL. Participation in the Filecoin DeFi ecosystem has been robust, with approximately 6,000 stakers and nearly 800 Storage Provider systems actively engaging in borrowing activities, as of December 2023. Notably, [Sushiswap went live on the FVM in November](https://www.sushi.com/blog/sushi-is-live-on-filecoin), further enhancing the vibrancy of the Filecoin DeFi space, while the [Uniswap community's approval of integrating v3 on the FVM](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/uniswap/proposal/50?chart=0), with a front-end interface set to launch in early 2024, heralds promising developments on the horizon.

## New Opportunities for Filecoin Scalability

### Compute over Data

This past year saw growing traction for a new paradigm in distributed computing - compute over data networks. The Filecoin ecosystem is full of many different approaches including Fission, Tau, Koii and many more. Incubated within Protocol Labs, the open-source platform [Bacalhau](https://www.bacalhau.org/), which helps builders co-locate storage and computation in decentralized infrastructures, addresses key limitations of existing decentralized compute issues.

Launched in 2022, the Bacalhau open-source community made strides towards production-readiness. Core optimizations improved performance for parallel workloads, with benchmarks showing superior efficiency versus centralized clouds. Modular architecture expanded language support beyond Docker to include Python, JavaScript and more.

In 2023, the platform continued to advance distributed compute architectures, and hit 1.0 in May at the 3rd compute over data conference. Further, advancements in use of GPUs, distributed job execution, and distributed consensus all became part of the core platform. Additionally, at Lab Week in Istanbul, the proof of concept Lilypad network was launched, with over 1000 job executions, making it a top 5 decentralized network in the world. 

Further, partner projects integrated Bacalhau into real-world applications:

- LabDAO is using Bacalhau as a decentralized network for lab management and on-premises decentralized execution.
- Heata utilized Bacalhau in their distributed "green cloud" platform spanning residential computing units. This showcases how decentralized infrastructure can achieve sustainability goals.
- Radix is integrating their platform with Bacalhau to deliver on-premises execution over complicated DAG pipelines.

Developer experience also improved with documentation revamps, tutorials, and discussion forums building an engaged community.

Moving into 2024, convergence around frameworks like Bacalhau is prompting specialized network stacks purpose-built for machine learning, media rendering, industrial edge intelligence and other domains. These promise to connect fragmented pockets of capacity while preserving privacy and user control. If current momentum holds, compute over data infrastructures may fundamentally reshape cloud and web3 landscapes over the coming decade. We welcome all builders aligned with the vision of decentralized computing for the people, by the people. Onwards to an abundant shared future!

Lassie makes it easy to fetch your data from both the Filecoin and IPFS Network - it will find and fetch content over the best retrieval protocols available. For end users and clients, this means you can easily retrieve your content addressed data (using CIDs) from Filecoin or IPFS using the Lassie client, without having to run your own IPFS node or Filecoin node.
- Boost released [Version 2](https://github.com/filecoin-project/boost/releases/tag/v2.0.0) which enables a Filecoin Storage Provider to horizontally  scale retrievals. 
- Indexer Scaling - The IPNI team accomplished a major goal in scaling the Indexer, handling upwards of 40B CIDs ingested per week , IPFS traffic, large IPFS clusters like web3.storage all while maintaining SLA uptime and reliability.  In addition, the team rolled out double hashing of indices for [reader privacy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q46zJ_mai2c).
- [Destor REST API](https://destor.com/destor-rest-api-for-filecoin) launched in Beta. The DeStor REST API for Filecoin (DRA) is open source software that provides a simple API for storing data to and retrieving data from Filecoin. It integrates seamlessly with an S3 connector so that those wanting to expose a Filecoin storage tier to their users can do so with the familiar S3 API’s.

#### Saturn

[Saturn](https://saturn.tech/) is a decentralized Content Delivery Network, offering beefy servers with very high bandwidth to accelerate retrievals from IPFS & Filecoin. At the beginning of 2023, Saturn had just a few hundred nodes. Now, Saturn has more than 3000 nodes on the network which are all community run. The global performance is also noteworthy, as Saturn improved its TTFB to sub 70ms and with further smart client routing, even down to 60ms, which makes Saturn the fastest dCDN for content-addressable data in the world. On the busiest day last year, Saturn served 400 Million requests in a single day, proving that it is ready for large scale applications in Web3. In 2023, Saturn launched further network tools, like the overhauled node provider dashboard and the [explorer](https://explorer.saturn.tech/). Additionally, Saturn is now able to fetch content from Filecoin and any public IPFS node.

To conclude an outstanding year in 2023, Saturn launched its private customer beta alongside an entirely new customer portal. If you are keen on becoming a Saturn customer, we invite you to join our exclusive invite-only [private beta](https://tally.so/r/mRo7xp) program.

#### Station

[Station](https://filstation.app/) is a DePIN deployment target for network builders, offering a wide variety of different nodes, from beefy servers to small desktop computers and Raspberry Pis, scattered across the globe. The first network, or “module”,  to run on Station is called Spark, which first launched in July 2023.

[Spark](https://filspark.com/) is a trustless protocol for sampling retrievals from Filecoin Storage Providers. Spark aims to improve the Filecoin retrieval success rate by performing these random samples. If a Storage Provider doesn’t know which CID it will be asked to serve, it has to keep all of them in hot storage ready for fast retrieval.

Spark is the first module that allows Station operators to get paid for running Station. The Station team launched Spark with FIL payouts in November 2023 and saw rapid growth in the number of active Stations, growing 100x from 50 to 5000 daily active Station nodes.

## Engineering and Network Upgrades

### Filecoin Implementation and Upgrades

Each upgrade marked a significant milestone in our journey towards a more robust Filecoin network and more useful and scalable implementations. Let's delve into these key developments that not only shaped the past year but will also continue to influence the trajectory of the network in the years ahead.

#### [Network Upgrade 18 - Hygge](https://github.com/filecoin-project/community/discussions/74?sort=new#discussioncomment-4313888)

On Pi Day, March 14, 2023, the Filecoin network celebrated a significant milestone with the Hygge upgrade. This upgrade introduced the Ethereum compatible Filecoin Virtual Machine (FEVM) to the mainnet, unlocking the potential for smart contracts and user programmability in the network. This transformative step not only enhanced the capabilities of the Filecoin network but also set the stage for a new era of innovation and development in the open data economy. A fitting tribute to the mathematical constant, the day was indeed full of π.

#### [Network upgrade 19 & 20 - Lightning and Thunder](https://github.com/filecoin-project/community/discussions/74?sort=new#discussioncomment-5376097)

Just as thunderstorms often arrive earlier than expected, so too did the lightning and thunder network upgrades. The data onboarding on the network continuously climbed over the year, pushing us to expedite the release of network upgrades 19 and 20. These network upgrades were implemented faster than anticipated to alleviate the network from heavy cron execution costs and substantially reducing block validation time. 

By reducing execution costs and validation time, we've made it possible for the network to handle larger volumes of data and deal transactions. This is a crucial step in ensuring that the network can continue to grow and serve an increasing number of users.

The lightning and thunder network upgrades also strengthened network security by introducing new windowPoSt proofs that generate challenges independent of the sector order.

#### [Network upgrade 21 - Watermelon](https://github.com/filecoin-project/community/discussions/74?sort=new#discussioncomment-7274188)

The last network upgrade in 2023, codenamed Watermelon, was implemented on December 12th. While watermelons are typically associated with summer, it's always summer somewhere on the planet. In this sweet and juicy upgrade, several key enhancements were introduced.

The upgrade allowed Storage Providers (SPs) to pledge and extend sectors for up to 3.5 years, under a total 5-year sector lifetime. This change also enables clients to make deals that last up to 3.5 years. Furthermore, the upgrade provides SPs and Sealing-as-a-Service providers with the ability to leverage synthetic proofs-of-replication, reducing their disk usage when storing temporary data when sealing. This not only cuts costs but also increases the sealing throughput, making the process more efficient and cost-effective.

Additionally, the network upgrade optimized and reduced gas usage when onboarding deal sectors to the network.

These enhancements, which have boosted both performance and reliability for network users, span several areas including infrastructure scaling and user experience. Here are some of the key improvements we've made:

- Production ready SplitStore: Early in the year, SplitStore made its way to production ready code after several sprints crushing bugs. The feature enables automatic discarding of older chain data and thereby reducing disk footprint and maintenance for node operators that do not need historical data.
- New client features: Throughout the year, lotus client has built features to support new network improvements delivered through network upgrades, from FEVM client feature, actor events, ETH APIs, as well as client improvements like default grafana dashboards and scalable Lotus chain infrastructure.
- Smoother network migrations: A significant effort has been invested in streamlining complex network migrations, with a focus on reducing pre-migration and migration time. This was clearly demonstrated during Network Upgrade 21, a particularly heavy migration. The effort was successful, as the network transitioned smoothly to the new version.
- Inspection tools: The ability to have network state and client profiling inspection tooling became apparent throughout the year, and Lotus now has the ability to monitor the network state growth over time and detect potential “red flags” earlier to prevent unexpected downgraded performance in the network. Check out an example of Filecoin State Usage Summary, or the Lotus Message Execution Profiling Report.
- Syncing improvements: Over the past year, the Filecoin network has evolved and we have seen new types of load and higher volumes in the network. We have continuously addressed these challenges by fixing bugs and enhancing stability to ensure a seamless synchronization experience for our users.
- Network security tools: The Lotus Slasher and Lotus Disputer tools were launched to maintain network integrity. These tools actively identify and report consensus faults, validate off-chain WindowPoST proofs, and discourage malicious activities in the network, all while remaining efficient and lightweight so it's easy to run. During Q4, the network observed 25 unique slashers and 14 unique disputers, demonstrating their active engagement in maintaining network security.

#### Lotus SP stack

Guided by invaluable feedback from Storage Providers, the SP stack roadmap for 2023 focused on pain points and top requested features with the greatest overall impact for storage providers. We initiated this roadmap in Q1 and continued to implement it throughout the year. Now, let's take a look at some of the key improvements introduced throughout the year:

- Operation Instability Bug Fixing Sprints: Several development sprints were specifically dedicated to addressing and fixing the top bugs causing operational instability for storage providers. These targeted efforts have significantly reduced the time storage providers spend on debugging and general issue resolution.
- Unsealing Enhancements: Significantly improving the unsealing process for storage providers, eliminating the need for manual work to attach workers to where the sealed sectors are stored. Made possible with the help of the proofs team building new proof APIs, this has increased efficiency and reliability in handling large volumes of sealed sectors being unsealed.
- Supranational PC2/C2: In collaboration with the Proofs team, the highly optimized brownfield PC2/C2 sealing proofs from SupraNational was implemented in the Lotus SP stack. This has resulted in a significant reduction in sealing times for the PC2/C2 tasks (by approximately 70+%), lowering energy usage, and reduced operational costs for our storage providers.
- Implementing SyntheticPoReps: In collaboration with the Proofs team, we implemented SyntheticPoReps in the Lotus SP stack. This significantly reduced temporary data storage during the sealing process, increased sealing throughput, and enabled batching larger PreCommit messages, leading to gas savings for storage providers.
- V2 Technical Design for High Availability (HA): Based on community feedback, we developed a V2 technical design to provide a High Availability solution for WindowPoSt/WinningPoSt. The design led to the development of Lotus-Provider, now in alpha state, often referred to as “Lotus-Miner-V2”.
- Lotus-Provider: Currently in alpha state, the lotus-provider binary aims to replace the need to run lotus-miner and lotus-worker in 2024. It consists of many features sought after in everything from small, medium and larger deployments, and tackles architectural challenges from our users feedback. Its a single binary that can easily be shipped across your fleet of servers, and can be started to do the task you want it to do by starting the binary with flags to find the database, and which configuration layers it should use. In alpha it supports High Availability for WindowPoSt and WinningPoSt, and features like multi-MinerID support, sealing and a webUI for your cluster is in active development.

#### Venus

The Venus team achieved significant milestones in 2023, elevating its representation in the Filecoin network from approximately 5% to a notable 15% of the total Qualified Adjusted Power (QAP). This trajectory is poised to reach an impressive 20% shortly, making a substantial impact on client diversity and fortifying network security. Explore below some of the notable features and advancements meticulously crafted by the team throughout the year, contributing to a more robust and engaging Filecoin community. 

1\. **Venus SP Stack Rebranding**: In a strategic move to facilitate a seamless transition for Service Providers (SPs) into the Venus SP stack, the team has rebranded key chain services components. Notably, [Sophon](https://sophon.venus-fil.io/) now represents the chain services, [Damocles](https://damocles.venus-fil.io/) replaces venus-cluster, and [Droplet](https://droplet.venus-fil.io/) takes the place of venus-market. This modularization not only streamlines the onboarding experience but also fosters increased community engagement from SPs of varying scales.

2\. **Production Hardened Node as a Service (NaaS)**: Throughout 2023, the team dedicated efforts to enhance the Node as a Service (NaaS) backed by Sophon. This service enables high-availability deployment of Lotus and Venus nodes, featuring performance improvements and bug fixes. With improved authentication systems for third-party consumption, NaaS not only helps SPs significantly reduce their operational expenses (OPex) but also serves as a cornerstone for many critical Filecoin infrastructures.

3\. **Supranational Proofs Integration**: The Venus SP stack incorporated Supranational proofs into production storage systems. This innovation allows SPs to experience a substantial speed boost in computing proofs for P2, C2, snapdeal, and windowPost. Damocles' innovative architecture facilitates lightning-fast proof integration, providing numerous Venus SPs with a competitive edge in their storage provision businesses.

4\. **Damocles Refactoring**: Responding to constructive feedback and close engagement with Venus SPs, Damocles underwent comprehensive refactoring. Components such as the external processor, configuration manager, windowPost execution, and Lotus compatibility manager were refined and improved. This effort resulted in an outstanding user experience for SPs, effectively reducing operational overhead in managing storage power for the Filecoin network.

5\. **Retrieval Capability Improvements for Droplet**: Various enhancements were introduced to Droplet to elevate its data retrieval capabilities. These include, but are not limited to, HTTP retrieval support, unsealing refactoring, metrics and visualization tools, and storage deal batching.
