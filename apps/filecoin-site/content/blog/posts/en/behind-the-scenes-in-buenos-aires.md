The future of the cloud took center stage in Argentina. Across three events, hundreds of builders gathered to celebrate a major milestone for the Filecoin network: the launch of Filecoin Onchain Cloud on November 18.

The momentum built throughout the week –– from collaborating on the network’s next phase at FIL Dev Summit 7, to unveiling Filecoin Onchain Cloud at DePIN Day, to showcasing cutting-edge applications and use cases with builders at Code n’ Corgi. 

Together, these events signaled expansion from a decentralized storage layer toward a verifiable, decentralized cloud foundation. Here’s a look back at the top themes, insights, and takeaways from a transformative week in Buenos Aires.

## Filecoin Onchain Cloud Launch @ DePIN Day

At the heart of Filecoin’s appearances in Buenos Aires was [DePIN Day 2025](https://depinspace.co/depin-day/buenos-aires/), where Filecoin Foundation and FilOz unveiled [Filecoin Onchain Cloud](https://filecoin.cloud/), a groundbreaking platform extending Filecoin’s decentralized storage into a fully verifiable, programmable cloud infrastructure. 

The Filecoin Onchain Cloud announcement, set against the backdrop of [a global Cloudflare outage](https://blog.cloudflare.com/18-november-2025-outage/), drew nearly 300 in-person attendees at DePIN Day, and the launch video had a cumulative reach of nearly 430K impressions and video views, signifying one of the year's most significant launches in decentralized infrastructure. 

[Filecoin Onchain Cloud](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/introducing-filecoin-onchain-cloud) is a decentralized cloud platform that brings verifiable storage, retrieval, and payments fully onchain. Built on the world’s largest decentralized storage network, Filecoin Onchain Cloud transforms core cloud functions into programmable, verifiable, and ownable services. The announcement notable launch partners and integrations, including: 

- Ecosystem integrations, like [Ethereum Name Service](https://ens.domains/) (ENS) and [Monad](https://www.monad.xyz/); 
- New warm storage services from [Akave](https://akave.com/) and [Storacha](https://storacha.network/); and 
- New dApps and tools from the [AKINDO Alpha Builder Cohort](https://app.akindo.io/wave-hacks/1PRjgGzKaTqXaQBBl), like [Cha-Ching](https://cha-ching.it/) and [Filosign](https://app.filosign.xyz/).

Additionally, The Block featured an [exclusive interview](https://www.theblock.co/post/379290/filecoin-foundation-filoz-unveil-decentralized-cloud-build-resilient-customizable-apps) with Juan Benet and Molly Mackinlay, explaining how any onchain product or service could ultimately be built on the decentralized cloud, enhancing programmability and resilience. 

Filecoin Onchain Cloud is just the start of a major expansion of the Filecoin network into a fully composable onchain cloud representing the foundation of a verifiable web where developers can own the cloud. 

### Start Building 

Over [500 early builders](https://app.akindo.io/wave-hacks/1PRjgGzKaTqXaQBBl?tab=overview) have already been experimenting with Filecoin Onchain Cloud for the last three months, building new dApps, tools, and communities with onchain verifiable storage and services. Filecoin Onchain Cloud is live on Filecoin testnet today, with mainnet launch planned for January 2026.

## FIL Dev Summit 7 

Held just prior to the Filecoin Onchain Cloud launch, Filecoin Dev Summit 7 brought builders, researchers, and ecosystem leaders to Buenos Aires, to collaborate on the networks’ next phase and connect with the wider world of Web3. Building on the discussions from its [virtual, online-only companion event in October](https://fil.org/events/virtual-fil-dev-summit-7), the community came together in person to align on strategy, tackle technical challenges, and facilitate cross-team coordination to support the network’s continued evolution. 

### Filecoin Onchain Cloud and Beyond

A key theme at FDS-7 was, naturally, the upcoming Filecoin Onchain Cloud launch.  Throughout the event, teams showcased Filecoin Onchain Cloud’s composable set of onchain services, including [Filecoin Beam](https://filbeam.com/), [Filecoin Pin](https://github.com/filecoin-project/filecoin-pin), [Filecoin Pay](https://pay.filecoin.cloud/), and the [Filecoin Warm Storage  Service](https://filecoin.cloud/warm-storage-service), and went deep on the architecture. Conversations went beyond the initial scope of the alpha launch and outlined improvements to support the broader needs of wider use cases, including interacting with AI agents, web payment standards, more durable data, faster resolution, and flexible access-controls. To dive deeper, check out these videos from FDS-7. 

Intro to Filecoin Onchain Cloud:

### Public Goods, Governance Highlights, and What’s Next 

Filecoin public goods are already supported with the Filecoin RetroPGF program, rewarding past work that benefits the community and a [ProPGF program](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/reflections-from-propgf-batch-1-what-we-learned-about-funding-impact-in-the-filecoin-ecosystem/) that awards larger sums to future public goods projects. While RetroPGF badgeholders voted on a [third round of funding](https://filecoin.drips.network/app/rpgf/rounds/fil-retropgf-3), FDS-7 attendees explored new methods for distributing FIL for public goods, including VeFIL, a proposed new network-wide way of allocating funds, with voting rights based on escrowed FIL. 

We also heard progress reports from the Filecoin governance team’s ongoing Constellation Program, focused on strengthening participation and decision-making across the ecosystem, and from the Filecoin Incentive Design Lab’s (FIDL) plans to make Filecoin’s rich world of open datasets more accessible.

How best can we self-organize to pursue such ambitious goals? FilOz’s Molly Mackinlay and Filecoin Foundation’s Marta Belcher walked through future directions and organizing strategies, including objectives and key results (OKRs) to find product market fit (PMF). On a lighter note Senior Fellow Danny O’Brien discovered it’s not important where you work or who you know in the Filecoiniverse: it’s why you knew who worked where – and when. And if you’d like to contribute more to ongoing PMF work, [you can join a short 20-minute call](https://destor.com/product-interview-booking) with the Filecoin product lead to share your perspective on what builders, businesses, and communities need.

### What’s Next

Filecoin Dev Summit 7 demonstrated the strength of the network’s collaborative DNA. Across four tracks, the community is coalescing around a shared future. The next phase will be about scaling this momentum into the broader Web3 landscape and beyond. This means: 

- Building on Filecoin Onchain Cloud momentum: Grow adoption of Filecoin Onchain Cloud by onboarding developers, deepening integrations, and using these workloads to drive meaningful onchain paid deals. 
- Doubling down on priority PMF markets: Focus engineering and product on a few high-potential target markets, and ship solutions that clearly solve real user problems and make a tangible difference for those users. 
- Aligning economics, funding, and governance for impact: Strengthen ecosystem-wide coordination so economic incentives, funding programs, and governance reforms all reinforce a shared set of goals that benefit the entire network. 

FDS-7 was the linchpin for conversations that the community can build on and carry into 2026 with more to come. We’ll soon be sharing new strategic priorities to support the ecosystem’s focus areas for 2026.

## Code N’ Corgi

​​​Filecoin ​Code N' Corgi, hosted by [FIL-B](https://fil.builders/), brought builders together for a hands-on afternoon exploring the latest Filecoin Onchain Cloud tooling. Builders got a first look at live demos, the architecture of Filecoin Onchain Cloud, and opportunities to start building with the engineers who helped create it. In addition to an [ENS Filecoin Onchain Cloud demo](https://github.com/FIL-Builders/filecoin-pin-ens-demo), attendees were able to launch their own ENS-hosted HTML sites. There was also an interactive dogfooding session for Filecoin Pin, and FIL-B demoed [building with the Filecoin Onchain Cloud MCP server for agentic storage](https://github.com/FIL-Builders/foc-storage-mcp).
