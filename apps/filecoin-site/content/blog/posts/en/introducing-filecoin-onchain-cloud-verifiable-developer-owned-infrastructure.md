_Early integrations from Ethereum Name Service (ENS), the ERC-8004 community, Monad, Akave, Storacha, and more_

**Buenos Aires, Argentina — November 18, 2025:** Today, the Filecoin ecosystem launched [Filecoin Onchain Cloud](http://www.filecoin.cloud), a decentralized cloud platform that brings verifiable storage, fast retrieval, and programmable payments fully onchain. Developers are already experimenting with early integrations from the ERC-8004 community, Ethereum Name Service (ENS), KYVE, Monad, Safe, Akave, Storacha, and more.

## Centralized Outages Expose Crypto’s Dependence

Recent global outages at major cloud providers have taken dApps, explorers, and wallets offline, exposing the decentralized web’s reliance on centralized infrastructure. Filecoin Onchain Cloud offers an alternative with a verifiable foundation for builders who want their infrastructure to be as open and resilient as the onchain systems they’re building on top of it.

## AI, Regulation, and Agents Push the Limits of Centralized Systems

At the same time, new forces are testing the limits of centralized infrastructure. AI systems are generating and consuming data at unprecedented scale. Governments are asserting jurisdiction over where that data can live. And as AI agents begin to transact directly onchain, they need payment and verification systems.

## A Foundation for Verifiable Infrastructure

Filecoin Onchain Cloud meets that demand by extending the Filecoin network into a programmable foundation for verifiable cloud services, giving developers the ability to compose storage, retrieval, and payment logic directly onchain.

“Filecoin Onchain Cloud brings onchain guarantees like verifiability, programmability, and openness to cloud-scale infra services,” says Molly Mackinlay, CEO, FilOz. “With storage, retrieval, and payments that are all fully composable and auditable onchain, all Web3 dApps, agents, and infra networks can be truly unstoppable and decentralized. Filecoin Onchain Cloud provides the building blocks applications need for a Cambrian explosion of onchain services powered by the global network of Filecoin service providers. Builders deserve a cloud built on proofs, not promises!”

## Five Years in the Making

Filecoin Onchain Cloud is the product of years of collaboration across the Filecoin ecosystem — bringing together new hot storage proofs, composable smart contracts, onchain payment rails, and global storage providers. It marks the next step in Filecoin’s evolution toward a fully verifiable, programmable data layer for the internet.

**Filecoin Pin**, launched in October, is the first developer toolkit built on Filecoin Onchain Cloud, demonstrating this foundation in action. Filecoin Pin persists Interplanetary File System (IPFS) content on Filecoin storage with simple tools and interfaces.

## A Cloud That Proves Itself

At launch, Filecoin Onchain Cloud introduces core services, including verifiable storage, incentivized retrieval, and onchain payments that form the base layer of a decentralized cloud. Developers can access these services through the easy-to-use **Synapse SDK**.

Each service is designed to make the infrastructure itself verifiable: **Filecoin Warm Storage Service** keeps data online and provably available through onchain proofs; **Filecoin Pay** automates usage-based payments, settling transactions only when delivery is confirmed; and **Filecoin Beam** enables measured, incentivized data retrievals. Together, these systems form a transparent foundation for developers to compose, monitor, and monetize data services.

## Early Integrations

Developers are already experimenting with early integrations from Akave, the ERC-8004 community, Ethereum Name Service (ENS), KYVE, Monad, Safe, Storacha, Geo Podcasts, and more.

**ERC-8004 / Agent0**\
ERC-8004 builders use Filecoin Pin to store agent identities and metadata verifiably onchain. Agent0 extends this by pinning all agent data to Filecoin, enabling tamper-proof discovery without centralized catalogs.

“Agent ecosystems depend on verifiable metadata,” said **Marc De Rossi, author of ERC-8004 and creator of [Agent0](https://sdk.ag0.xyz/)**. “By pinning agent identity and reputation data on Filecoin Onchain Cloud, we can ensure that discovery and interaction between agents happens on tamper-proof infrastructure. It’s a huge step toward an open standard for verifiable AI.”

**Ethereum Name Service (ENS) and Safe**\
ENS, Safe, and Filecoin Onchain Cloud form an onchain stack for deploying and governing trustless frontends. ENS provides naming, Safe provides multi-sig governance, and Filecoin Onchain Cloud ensures persistent, verifiable storage that will keep frontends transparent, available, and user-owned.

"Using ENS to give names for content and apps on the decentralized web has been possible since 2018,” said **Simon Schmid, Developer Relations Lead, ENS Labs**. “With Filecoin Onchain Cloud it is now possible to properly incentivize storage and availability at scale in a decentralized way. Super excited to see all the pieces coming together with Safe leading as an example of how it’s done," 

**Monad**\
Through the Monad AI Blueprint program, developers can seamlessly deploy Filecoin Onchain Cloud storage endpoints and build AI systems that are fast, self-verifying, and wallet-controlled.

**KYVE**\
KYVE uses Filecoin Onchain Cloud to durably store Celestia and Story Protocol chain data across decentralized providers. After beginning in the Arweave ecosystem, they’re expanding to Filecoin for greater scale and faster validator syncing.

“At KYVE, our mission has always been to make blockchain data permanent, verified, and accessible to everyone,” said **Fabian Riewe, Founder, KYVE**. “By leveraging Filecoin’s Onchain Cloud, we’re taking the next step, scaling from terabytes to petabytes of decentralized storage. This collaboration brings us closer to a truly universal data infrastructure for Web3.”

**Akave Cloud**\
Akave Cloud is using Filecoin Onchain Cloud to extend verifiable storage from hot workloads into a decentralized backup and archiving tier built for AI, IoT, ML, and compliance data that demands durable, auditable, affordable storage. 

“By uniting Akave Cloud’s high-performance, verifiable S3-compatible infrastructure with Filecoin Onchain Cloud’s global decentralized storage network and services, users will gain more flexibility and have the ability to optimize for cost, speed, and durability within a seamless, unified system,” said **Stefaan Vervaet, CEO, Akave**.

**Storacha**\
Storacha’s Forge offers IPFS-compatible warm storage with onchain proofs of data possession for $5.99/TB per month. It provides high-throughput, auditable storage secured by Filecoin Onchain Cloud’s verification and payment rails.

“Storacha Forge is a new Filecoin Onchain Cloud service making verifiable warm storage radically affordable,” said **Alexander Kinstler, CEO of Storacha**. “At $5.99 per terabyte, Storacha Forge is built for the petabyte-scale data behind AI and DePIN. By building on the Filecoin Onchain Cloud, we combine cryptographic integrity with unmatched economics.”

**Geo Podcasts**\
Geo Podcasts is built on the Geo knowledge-graph protocol and helps users discover top podcasts by topic. By storing its podcast data, images, and knowledge-graph records on Filecoin Onchain Cloud, Geo Podcasts ensures that all information is verifiable across applications.

“We want to make sure that all of Geo’s knowledge graph data is open and available to all,” said **Yaniv Tal, Founder, Geo**. “Filecoin Onchain Cloud gives users guarantees that their knowledge data will stay around, giving them even more confidence to contribute to the Geo knowledge commons.”

## An Open Foundation

Filecoin Onchain Cloud lays the groundwork for a verifiable cloud ecosystem. Its initial modules enable transparent, auditable service delivery, and ongoing collaboration with the Filecoin developer community will continue to grow the stack.

“Launching Filecoin Onchain Cloud is a huge milestone for the Filecoin network,” said **Marta Belcher, President and Chair of the Filecoin Foundation**. "FOC unlocks critical capabilities that will accelerate the Filecoin network’s mission to build a more open, resilient, and verifiable internet."

Filecoin Onchain Cloud is live on Filecoin testnet today, with mainnet launch planned for January 2026.
