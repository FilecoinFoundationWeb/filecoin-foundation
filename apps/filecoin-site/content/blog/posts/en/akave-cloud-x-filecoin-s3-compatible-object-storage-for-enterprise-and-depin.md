Over the last four years, institutions have explored the Filecoin ecosystem, drawn in by promises of lower storage costs, robust data controls, and tamper-proof immutability enabled by decentralized infrastructure. Yet, despite interest, a significant hurdle remained: the cost and complexity of transitioning legacy systems. Most organizations are hesitant to overhaul their core applications to embrace new technology; instead, they want seamless solutions that work with their current workflows, leveraging familiar interfaces, such as S3-compatible object storage, before considering deeper programmability and custom SDKs.

This is how we started Akave: the journey began with direct requests from real users eager to make the leap to decentralized storage without sacrificing the tools and processes they already trusted. By focusing on drop-in compatibility and intuitive migration, Akave Cloud was purpose-built to allow institutions and DePIN projects to seamlessly bridge the gap between traditional and decentralized storage, empowering them to unlock all the benefits of Filecoin and next-generation data sovereignty, right from day one.

## S3-Compatible Object Storage: Drop-in Simplicity, Decentralized Power

Akave Cloud is designed as a fully [S3-compatible object storage layer](https://akave.com/why-akave-cloud)—allowing businesses, AI/ML teams, and DePIN projects to migrate at their own pace, without new software or complex integration while maintaining the benefits of onchain verifiability. Through familiar S3 APIs, organizations can manage, migrate, and access data using the same tools they know from Web2 clouds, while gaining all the advantages of Filecoin-backed decentralization. This compatibility means instant onboarding; data lakes, model artifacts, and analytics pipelines all just work and immutable CIDs are tracked for each data object.

Also, all storage actions (uploads, reads, access permissions) are immutably logged onchain, providing auditability and compliance. Akave’s multi-tier storage, combining a high-speed hot tier and cost-efficient Filecoin-based archiving, enables both immediate access and cryptographically-proven durability. Data is encrypted, erasure-coded, and distributed with advanced redundancy, ensuring up to 11x9s durability.

## Why Are DePIN and Institutions Migrating?

While large enterprises have historically moved cautiously and slowly, the IoT DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network) sector, typically powered by edge devices or robotics, has rapidly driven demand for verifiable, blockchain-powered storage. Even DePIN projects, born in Web3, have enterprise-grade needs. Their de facto storage layers are still AWS, GCP and MSFT cloud.

Feedback from DePIN projects and institutions repeatedly identifies four must-haves for migration:

1. Lower Cost: Decentralized storage drastically reduces per-terabyte spending and eliminates the high egress (data exit) fees that often inflate total costs in hyperscaler clouds. These egress charges, applied whenever data is moved out, create vendor lock-in and unpredictable expenses.
2. Plug-and-play with existing cloud apps: Storage must be instantly accessible from existing apps and routines via S3-Compatible Object APIs, allowing migration across workloads and clouds and providing easy data access for data buyers, typically using web2 cloud tools as well.
3. Immutable Onchain References: True value comes from onchain audit trails, where every report, dataset, and backup can be verified, traced, and attested to on the blockchain for compliance, monetization, and trust.
4. Compliance and Data Sovereignty: Businesses and DePIN projects collecting datasets, need to ensure data remains within chosen jurisdictions and under their exclusive control, in line with local regulations and organizational policy (e.g. GDPR in Europe). Decentralized storage empowers businesses with user-controlled encryption, more local coverage, technically enforced data sovereignty (geofencing and more), enabling robust compliance strategies that are less feasible with traditional centralized clouds.

Akave Cloud was engineered specifically around these pain points. By delivering programmable access control, zoning, and onchain verifiability, all behind an S3-compatible interface, Akave removes the last mile of enterprise migration friction.

## Evolving With Filecoin: Archival and PDP-Powered Warm Storage

Akave Cloud’s foundation has been Filecoin’s Proof-of-Replication (PoRep), cryptographically proving archives are truly stored and making it the premier choice for regulated backups, tamper-proof retention, and disaster recovery.

Now, with the introduction of Proof of Data Possession (PDP), Akave’s goal is to enable “warm” data use cases as well for files that require instant access and regular modification but still need proof of availability and integrity. PDP lets storage providers cryptographically prove, on-demand, that your hot data is immediately available. This unlocks new possibilities for AI training, dApp hosting, and any workload demanding verifiable, low-latency reads, all within Akave’s decentralized S3-compatible framework.

## Use Cases with Verifiable Data Storage

- AI Infrastructure: Secure model training pipelines and guarantee the provenance of datasets, with persistent, auditable storage to build trust and scalability.
- Regulated Industries: Guarantee compliance and data sovereignty by implementing granular, blockchain-based access controls and immutable audit trails.
- Enterprise IT & Backups: Build ransomware-resilient IT with decentralized, erasure-coded backups, reducing single points of failure and supporting continuity requirements.
- DePIN Builders: Deliver robust, verifiable storage for decentralized infrastructure projects, supporting data sales, aggregation, and onchain compliance.
- Data Lakes & Analytics: Ingest and analyze data within a decentralized backend, enjoying automated governance, flexible access control, and long-term durability.

## The Road Ahead: Onboarding the Next Wave

Akave Cloud is already empowering data-driven organizations to benefit from:

- Up to [80% lower storage costs](https://akave.com/blog/no-more-egress-fees-how-akave-cloud-simplifies-cloud-storage) over centralized clouds
- Seamless onboarding via S3-compatible APIs and SDKs
- Fully programmable, onchain-managed data zones and policies
- Global, configurable compliance and audit support
- Multi-tier storage: high-speed for hot data, Filecoin for long-term archiving

Early adopters, including leading DePIN projects and compliance-driven enterprises, are already experiencing the transformational potential of this model.
