During Filecoin Liftoff week, we had the pleasure of hosting Jonathan Dotan, who gave this talk introducing the Starling Framework for Data Integrity.

Learn how Filecoinâ€™s unique cryptographic proofs are being put to the task of establishing trust in our most sensitive digital records, such as the documentation of human rights violations, war crimes and testimony of genocide.

Jonathan reflects on the path ahead for authenticated imagery, its evolving technical and ethical dimensions, and how Starling is being applied to advance humanitarian relief and accountability efforts in the future.
