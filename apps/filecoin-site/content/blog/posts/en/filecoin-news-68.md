### Apply to HackFS '23 to win $125k+ in prizes

Join us on June 2nd for the fourth [HackFS](https://filecoin.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0bc14cd7b6583be73cea72a5d&id=63975226c0&e=e64b38a79e) in a row, an online hackathon hosted by ETHGlobal and Protocol Labs. HackFS started with a bunch of curious folks from the community and Protocol Labs who were all hacking to build a robust, decentralized, secure and peer-to-peer internet, which in a large part has to do with how data (aka files) are stored and moved around the internet. We have seen some amazing projects originate from our hackathons and turn into scaleable, successful companies that have raised millions: [Huddle01](https://filecoin.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0bc14cd7b6583be73cea72a5d&id=26d9b3292e&e=e64b38a79e), [Lighthouse Storage](https://filecoin.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0bc14cd7b6583be73cea72a5d&id=bed61d9c39&e=e64b38a79e), [Secured Finance](https://filecoin.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0bc14cd7b6583be73cea72a5d&id=b72d4c3df5&e=e64b38a79e), and many more!

### Onboarding large scale customer data with Filecoin Data Tools

The Engineering team within the Filecoin ecosystem recently launched the Filecoin Data Tools (FDT) project to begin large scale onboarding of customer data. This platform has demonstrated the ease of use to rapidly and seamlessly onboard data through three pilot initiatives and is now ready to begin supporting more and more customers within the Filecoin ecosystem. Read this [recent blog post](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/introducing-filecoin-data-tools-fdt/) to learn more about the lineup of technology plus a glimpse of the clients already leveraging FDT like [Radiant Earth](https://radiant.earth/) and [SUCHO](https://www.sucho.org/). 

### Maximize your Filecoin storage potential with booster-http and nginx

Filecoin Storage Providers can now serve blocks and files over HTTP, leveraging powerful tools like load balancers and reverse proxies. Clients can request uploaded files directly from their browsers, enhancing the user experience. Additionally, users can protect their booster-http server with nginx, plus serving files over HTTP unlocks a powerful ecosystem of tools for Storage Providers (SPs). Learn more about [serving files with booster-http](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/serving-files-with-booster-http/) and [protecting booster-http with nginx](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/protecting-booster-http-with-nginx/).
