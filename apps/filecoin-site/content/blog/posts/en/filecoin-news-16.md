## Filecoin Launchpad Accelerator II

Tachyon’s Filecoin Launchpad Accelerator is a full-time, fully remote program designed to help startups build more open, interoperable, and programmable tools, infrastructure, and applications for the distributed and decentralized web. Via the program, Tachyon supports projects that build on and bridge the [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech/), [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io/), and [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) communities with tools, middleware, and applications. The next cohort will run from June through August 2021, providing 20 teams from around the globe with funding, mentorship, benefits, and programming around business and blockchain-specific issues, culminating in a Demo Day and post-program fundraising support kicking off in September. Applications are now open, and close at midnight EST on May 9. [Apply now](https://tachyon.submittable.com/submit/192229/filecoin-launchpad-accelerator-ii).

## FilRep.io - A Filecoin Miner Reputation System v1 by Digital Mob

[Digital MOB](http://digitalmob.ro/) has launched the first version of their Filecoin Miner Reputation System, available now at [Filrep.io](https://filrep.io/). A reliable reputation system is crucial to the health of the Filecoin ecosystem. Storage clients must navigate a sea of storage miners to discover those who are the best match for their specific needs. The raison d’etre of the reputation system is to help them achieve this.

## Filecoin Ambassadors Program

We are excited to introduce the Interplanetary Community Ambassadors Pilot Program — Filecoin Track. Although the Filecoin community is still young compared to other Interplanetary communities like those of IPLD and IPFS, it is thriving, active, and incredibly supportive. Therefore, we are very excited to create a new opportunity for individual community members to continue to steward the Filecoin community as ambassadors. This 6-week pilot program will aim to enable each community ambassador to support active engagement in the community, develop crucial community management skills, and learn innovative ways to support Filecoin miners, clients, and developers. Discover more details and find out [how to participate](https://github.com/filecoin-project/community/discussions/116)!
