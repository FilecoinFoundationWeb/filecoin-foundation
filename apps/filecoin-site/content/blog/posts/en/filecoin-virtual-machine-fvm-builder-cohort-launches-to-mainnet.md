On March 14th, 2023, the EVM-compatible [Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM)](http://fvm.filecoin.io/) launched to mainnet. Leading up to launch, since February 2023, 60+ project teams were building with FVM on its Hyperspace testnet. These teams are part of the FVM Mainnet Pioneers cohort, which was a 6-week program that provided technical, product, business mentorship, and resources to selected teams. 

The FVM Mainnet Pioneers cohort aimed to support the creation of impactful and sustainable solutions, on FVM, as part of the growing [Protocol Labs](http://protocol.ai/) network and saw strong interest from the Filecoin community and beyond. Teams with impactful ideas and skilled, credible teams were accepted. 

The cohort graduated on April 25, 2023 and concluded with a showcase of  the founders’ storage-focused projects and a very successful pitch day that was open to the Filecoin community. The projects demonstrated the diversity of opportunities that FVM unlocks, including staking protocols, dataDAOs, decentralized computation frameworks and more.

The first to launch were [block explorer projects](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/the-fvm-imaginarium-block-explorers/) and [staking and leasing protocols](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/fvm-imaginarium-staking-and-leasing-protocols/), which have been steadily gaining users. Since then, 21 more FVM Mainnet Pioneer projects have launched on mainnet, with more to come once [contract verification](https://docs.filecoin.io/smart-contracts/developing-contracts/verify-contracts/) and security audits have been completed to ensure transparency and trust on the protocol.

Following the cohort’s graduation, 20+ teams have been accepted into accelerator programs, with FVM-focused cohorts run by [GraphPaperCapital](https://www.graphpapercapital.xyz/), [LongHash](https://www.longhash.vc/), [Outlier Ventures](https://outlierventures.io/). To learn more about each of these projects, check out the list below. 

## [Creds Protocol](https://creds-protocol-documentation.vercel.app/) - Enabling zero-knowledge identity solutions on-chain

Creds Protocol is a decentralized identity and verification protocol that leverages zero-knowledge proofs to provide a privacy-preserving solution. The protocol allows users to prove their identity and other attributes without revealing any sensitive information to third parties. Creds Protocol can create verifiable credentials (cred) that represent the right to access content via FVM, which can be used for pay-per-view use cases and more. Based on Creds Prototcol, Creds badge is a non-transferable token (SBT) that represents a verifiable claim. 

## ShaleProtocol - Production-ready LLM inference APIs

Shale-Serve API is a production-ready inference API for open LLMs (large language models). It currently supports [Vicuna-13b](https://lmsys.org/blog/2023-03-30-vicuna/). It can be used as a drop-in replacement for the OpenAI API (specifically GPT3.5-turbo) in any language, including Python, cURL, and HTTP requests. Furthermore, the API is integrated with [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/providers/shaleprotocol/). The protocol aims to build a network of interoperable domain-specific LLMs by supporting thousands of open LLMs by 2025. 

## [Cookbook.dev](https://www.cookbook.dev/filecoin) - FVM smart contract hub

Cookbook is an open source smart contract registry and marketplace. It allows users to search, contribute, and integrate any Solidity smart contract into their app. Cookbook has built a [Filecoin Ecosystem Hub](https://www.cookbook.dev/filecoin) showcasing projects within the FEVM ecosystem. From there, any developer can get familiar with - and start building off of - the protocols that power the Filecoin network.

## [Resolutio](https://resolutio.ai/) - One stop solution to fighting NFT scams. 

Resolutio is a decentralized justice and social platform, built as a service with IPFS, NFT.storage and FVM and aims to overcome the high costs and inaccessibility of legal aid and legal tools to protect art or literary work. Resolutio has built a decentralized dispute resolution platform (DDRP). The DDRP deploys smart contracts for dispute resolution on FVM, uses IPFS for evidence management and IPFS-http-client and NFT.storage for decision NFTs that capture the outcome of the resolution.

## [Filemarket](https://filemarket.xyz/) - New token standard for encrypted NFTs

Filemarket has developed a protocol that allows users to mint NFTs with attached encrypted files of any size stored on Filecoin, which can only be accessed exclusively by the owner of the NFT. This solution allows creators to monetize their content while protecting and securing their intellectual property. As part of their launch, they have now launched their [Filebunnies collection](https://filebunnies.xyz/) of cool Filecoin-inspired NFT designs that hold encrypted ‘treasures’ in them and are offering limited free minting. 

## [Trustified](https://www.trustified.in/) - Issue tamper-proof, verifiable and perpetual certificates

Trustified is a no-code platform designed to issue tamper-proof, universally verifiable, and perpetual certificates on blockchains. A document that cannot be verified and is not tamper-proof does not prove its authenticity. Through Trustified, these digital credentials are issued on a blockchain, stored on Filecoin and can remain secure and accessible for perpetuity.

## [LYNC](https://lync.world/) - Build fast, Fail fast and Ship fast your Web3 games

LYNC is building GameFi infrastructure, making blockchain gaming accessible for everyone. Allowing game devs to build fast, ship fast, and fail faster without worrying about Web3 complexities. LYNC provides a scalable infrastructure for launching web3 games and fully supports FVM, which is great for deploying NFT collections and dynamic NFTs in-game that are stored on Filecoin.

## Clover - G-suite productivity for DAOs

Clover is a decentralized collaboration tool for DAOs, with built-in integrations with FVM, IPFS, and Web3.storage. It aims to reduce latency in information dissemination and decision making for DAOs. It uses NFT-gating for authentication, IPFS for DAO storage, and is integrated with [Huddle's](https://fvm.huddle01.com/) dRTC for DAO meetings.

## MomentSwap - Decentralized image-sharing social media platform

MomentSwap is an FVM-based social media platform that makes sharing wonderful moments easy and profitable. The project uses the infrastructure of FVM and its EVM compatibility to implement, debug and call contracts. User data is stored on the Filecoin network, and uses The Graph for data analysis, achieving complete decentralization. With MomentSwap, you have the advantage of being in complete control of your assets with a seamless and decentralized experience. Additional revenue can also be achieved through sharing and influence in the decentralized web.

## [Collectif DAO](https://collectif.finance/) - Non-custodial liquid leasing protocol

Collectif DAO optimizes FIL earning potential by leasing FIL as collateral into the network's most sophisticated Storage Providers. Leveraging a deep understanding of the Filecoin economy and cutting-edge financial models, Collectif DAO gives FIL token holders unrivaled access to high fees. With the help of FVM capabilities, the platform enhances the distribution of FIL, fostering a resilient and balanced growth of the Filecoin ecosystem. 

## [STFIL](https://www.stfil.io/) - Liquid leasing with compounding rewards 

STFIL Protocol is one of the first Filecoin liquidity and leveraged farming protocols launched on FVM. It enables $FIL token holders to earn stable fees without a locking period and offers storage providers undercollateralized FIL for leveraged farming positions. As a pioneer on FVM, STFIL is dedicated to providing decentralized and trustless FIL leasing while ensuring higher profitability. The protocol is incubated by [Outlier Ventures](https://twitter.com/oviohq/status/1662062713550299136?s=46&t=XwjlEiqmvBvELhXXb60cUw) and has been featured in the Filecoin & IPFS Ecosystem Roundup 'Wins of the Month.'

## [Jackrabbit Finance](http://jackrabbitfinance.xyz/) - Decentralized bond exchange

Jackrabbit is a Decentralized Bond Exchange (AMM) on the Filecoin Virtual Machine. It utilizes decentralized bond tokens (ERC-3475) for Filecoin Storage Providers to raise funds.  This brings traditional finance’s lending and borrowing method to DeFi. Jackrabbit also supports native FVM tokens (swaps and liquidity pools) to enhance the Filecoin ecosystem.
