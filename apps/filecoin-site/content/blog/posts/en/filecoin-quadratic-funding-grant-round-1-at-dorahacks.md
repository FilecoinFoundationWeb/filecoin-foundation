**About the Filecoin Quadratic Funding Grant Round-1**

Filecoin Quadratic Funding Grant Round-1 runs now until July 18, 2021. Developers participating in this round should submit projects in the ‘Submit BUIDL’ page and select "Filecoin Grant Round 1" as project source. Submitted projects will display on the round's detail page, and a real-time community donation ranking will be available on the leaderboard. accepts following types of projects, projects should include the following elements:

**IPFS & Filecoin for NFTs** - Solve a problem that the NFT explosion brings - archiving or organizing collections, NFT backpacks or widgets or other ways to show off your collection, tools for valuation or provenance connections, tools for management and publishing.

**Developer Tools** - We live in a mostly HTTP world, and all our tools assume it's the protocol we' re using. We need you to build new tools for debugging, diagnosing, visualizing or otherwise aiding development with IPFS, Filecoin and libp2p. Anything that makes developers' lives easier counts!

**Decentralizing Data** - We challenge you to find existing data and make it available on IPFS - map data, historical data, content archives, financial data. Included in this challenge is tooling - libraries for automatically publishing from existing HTTP datasources to IPFS, or managing updates to existing data, or tools for indexing, searching and managing large data sets.

While the event kicked off in May, the deadline for submissions is still open! Get all of the details on how you can participate.
