### Wolfram Blockchain Labs Expanding Storage Functionality with IPFS & Filecoin for Dapp Development

Expanding available tooling options for developers to create new decentralized applications is critical for the growth of the IPFS and Filecoin ecosystems. In a new collaboration with Protocol Labs, [**Wolfram Blockchain Labs**](https://www.wolframblockchainlabs.com/) (WBL) will offer developers the opportunity to leverage storage, peer-to-peer networking, and other protocols to complement their existing applications.

WBL is integrating their distributed ledger technology platform with IPFS and Filecoin to add new decentralized functionality and expanded storage to their existing blockchain features. Through the integration, developers will be able to access new tool sets from Wolfram Technologies, including the Wolfram programming language, Cloud, and Notebooks. [**Read our recent blog post to learn more about the collaboration.**](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/wolfram-blockchain-labs-expanding-storage-functionality-with-ipfs-filecoin-for-dapp-development/)

### Use Estuary Node to store and retrieve your data from the Filecoin Network

[**Estuary**](https://github.com/application-research/estuary-www) is a network node that bridges IPFS ⇆ Filecoin. Unlike other nodes, Estuary ensures your storage and retrieval goals match your own storage heuristics. Estuary uses automation to make Filecoin storage deals, restore IPFS pins with Filecoin retrieval deals, and repairs deals against reliable miners. The outcome is that there is a higher guarantee of on chain data, and a higher guarantee your data won't disappear from the internet. Jimmy Lee’s Dorahack presentation was an early preview of what led up to our learnings, and the API and documentation we plan on releasing to the community. To contribute to the community discussion, [**see here**](https://github.com/filecoin-project/community/discussions/105).

### Lighthouse Filecoin-Ethereum Cross Chain Infra Project

[**The Lighthouse project**](https://nanditmehra123.medium.com/lighthouse-filecoin-ethereum-cross-chain-infra-project-66c041a1a1db) provides a way for Ethereum smart contracts to request Filecoin storage of CIDs in IPFS via Textile.io’s Powergate, which simplifies Filecoin storage workflows from IPFS. Using Lighthouse, Ethereum developers can request verifiable storage of data to Filecoin from Ethereum smart contracts.

The project allows Ethereum developers to easily extend their IPFS storage with cryptographically verifiable and incentivized storage on Filecoin. Lighthouse greatly reduces the friction for Ethereum developers to interact with the Filecoin storage network by allowing them to store files on Filecoin by directly interacting with a Lighthouse smart contract deployed on Ethereum. This project was originally inspired by the [**Quasar project**](https://github.com/infinitescroll/quasar) that had been explored for Aragon and IPFS. To learn more about Lighthouse, how it works, and how to use it, [**read this article.**](https://nanditmehra123.medium.com/lighthouse-filecoin-ethereum-cross-chain-infra-project-66c041a1a1db)

### Filecoin Plus Day Recap

[**The Filecoin Foundation**](https://fil.org/) and Protocol Labs hosted the first Filecoin Plus Day on May 11. Over the course of three hours, more than 100 participants — including project architects, Filecoin Plus users, cryptoecon experts, and miners — came together to talk about the program. These groups are working together to maximize the amount of useful storage on Filecoin by adding a layer of social trust to the network. Thank you to all who participated and joined us! We plan to host more Filecoin Plus Days in the coming months but in the meantime, [**catch up on what you missed at this first event.**](https://filecoinfoundation.medium.com/missed-the-first-filecoin-plus-day-weve-got-you-covered-638f9eba7abf)

## Updates

[![](/uploads/lot-logo-symbol-color.webp)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmrLfnqzflk)

### Lotus Update

Lotus has released [**v1.9.0**](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/releases/tag/v1.9.0), which introduces various improvements to the sealing, mining and deal making process with proof [**v7.0.1**](https://github.com/filecoin-project/rust-fil-proofs/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) and market [**v1.2.5**](https://github.com/filecoin-project/go-fil-markets/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)integrated. Some highlights are: GPU2 is now enabled by default which results in faster winningPoSt, PC2 and C2 computation. Lotus now offers prebuilt binaries upon releases, check the latest ones in the release assets. If you have any question or feedback on this release, feel free to leave a comment in the [**discussion**](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/discussions/6274).

The lotus team is now working on the [**next release**](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/issues/6185) to support [**Network HyperDrive**](https://github.com/filecoin-project/community/discussions/74#discussioncomment-707228) with actor v5, which will introduce aggregated PoReps and batch pre-commitment features from FIP0013 and FIP0008. This will increase chain capacity drastically and allow miners to onboarding more storage and data to the network cheaper. In addition, FIP0012 is also being implemented where a verified client address can get datacap topups. Follow this discussion to get the latest updates!

In parallel to everything above, the Lotus team is working on rearchitecting the miner runtime. We are segregating the markets functionality so that it can run in a separate physical process from the storage/block mining. We believe this will improve robustness and resilience of miner deployments, and will unlock new heights of scalability on the storage and retrieval markets. Find out more in the [**project proposal**](https://github.com/protocol/web3-dev-team/blob/main/proposals/lotus-miner-runtime-segregation.md), as well as in [**this talk**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmrLfnqzflk).
