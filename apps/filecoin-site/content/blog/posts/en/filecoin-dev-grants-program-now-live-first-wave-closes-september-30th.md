Filecoin is much more than just a file storage network. It aims to be a decentralized, robust, and efficient foundation for humanity’s information. This vision is ambitious, and we can’t do it alone! The Filecoin network needs a vibrant and diverse community of participants working together to build the ecosystem of tools and services needed to improve Filecoin and make it usable in countless real-world applications.

Today, we are delighted to announce the [Filecoin Dev Grants Program](http://filecoin.io/grants). The Dev Grants Program aims to **reward** ongoing and existing contributions that add great value to the Filecoin ecosystem, **inspire** more contributors to solve open problems, and **seed** the creation of new products, businesses, and tools that increase the utility of Filecoin.

We are looking to fund talented and eager individuals and teams interested in contributing to open-source. To get started, take a look at our existing [Requests for Proposals (RFPs)](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#requests-for-proposals-rfps). We are looking to fund developer tools, user-facing applications, protocol improvements, and more. If you’re interested in building something else, you can [submit a proposal to our Open category](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants#submit-a-proposal-for-open-grants)!

We are currently accepting applications for the first wave of grants. The first wave application cycle is **open now** and **closes September 30th, 2019**. [Please visit our GitHub repo to learn more about the proposal process, open RFPs, review process, and more](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants). New RFPs may go live at any point, so watch the Dev Grants repo to stay on top of our updated list of RFPs. We will be running application cycles (“waves”) every 3 months.

The Dev Grants Program is only the beginning. We are excited to build a more robust, efficient, and decentralized web with you!
