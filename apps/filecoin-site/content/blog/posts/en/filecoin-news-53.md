As ChainSafe‚Äôs Rust implementation of the Filecoin protocol, it will bring diversity and resilience to the network thanks to the language‚Äôs prioritization of memory safety and performance.

### Filecoin Data Explorer

The Lotus community has built a new tool that lets you explore data on the Filecoin Network. While still a work-in-progress, you can already use it to see Storage Providers on the network and find out more information about their deal history and availability. The tool also allows you to click into files that are stored with the SP and open them in your browser. Check it out for yourself on [GitHub](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/9382) or watch a [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2c95KzN-oE) to learn how to use it.
