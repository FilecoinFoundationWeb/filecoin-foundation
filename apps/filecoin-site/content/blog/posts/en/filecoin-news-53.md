The community has built a place for Storage Providers to find funding opportunities and help finance their operations. On the new website, SPs can find information about lenders and complete a short survey to evaluate their options. Some lenders include CoinList, Anchorage Digital Bank, Darma Capital, HashMix, and PalladiumX.

### An Update on Forest

Forest has been a major contributor to the upcoming FVM launch by providing Rust code for _actors_ (the FVM term for smart contracts). As ChainSafe’s Rust implementation of the Filecoin protocol, it will bring diversity and resilience to the network thanks to the language’s prioritization of memory safety and performance. Read through an update on Forest’s Q3 2022 progress on the [ChainSafe blog](https://blog.chainsafe.io/glow-of-the-canopy-3-sprucing-up-3e065f4fb038).

## Tools

[![](/uploads/lotus.webp)](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/9382)

### Filecoin Data Explorer

The Lotus community has built a new tool that lets you explore data on the Filecoin Network. While still a work-in-progress, you can already use it to see Storage Providers on the network and find out more information about their deal history and availability. The tool also allows you to click into files that are stored with the SP and open them in your browser. Check it out for yourself on [GitHub](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/9382) or watch a [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2c95KzN-oE) to learn how to use it.
