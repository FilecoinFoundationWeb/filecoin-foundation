## Filecoin’s Building Blocks

Within the complex framework of Filecoin, fundamental building blocks serve as the solid foundation, reinforcing the network's infrastructure and propelling it towards enhanced decentralization, heightened security, and continuous innovation. Among these pivotal components are IPFS, libp2p, and drand, each playing a distinctive role in shaping the network’s foundation.

### IPFS & libp2p

In the realm of [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech/) and [libp2p](https://libp2p.io/), 2023 has been a year of substantial progress, milestones, and community engagement. IPFS has continued its mission of making the web peer-to-peer, with notable advancements since 2022. The introduction of the [probelab.io observatory](https://blog.ipfs.tech/2023-ipfs-observatory/) for the IPFS community, the release of the fast IPFS implementation in Java called [Nabu](https://blog.ipfs.tech/2023-11-introducing-nabu/), and the launch of [Helia](https://blog.ipfs.tech/202305-js-ipfs-deprecation-for-helia/)—a composable, lightweight replacement for js-IPFS—highlight the platform's commitment to innovation. IPFS garnered wider adoption, with [Brave extending support into its privacy-first browser](https://blog.ipfs.tech/_2023-brave-infobar/) and [IPFS functionality integrated into the widely used curl tool](https://blog.ipfs.tech/ipfs-uri-support-in-curl/). The culmination of these efforts was showcased at the [IPFS Thing 2023](https://blog.ipfs.tech/2023-ipfs-thing-recap/) event in Brussels, where the IPFS implementers community gathered for five days of discussions, talks, and demos, showcasing recent advances and charting new directions for the future.

Looking ahead to 2024, the IPFS roadmap includes the landing of the new Interplanetary Foundation, further improvements in resiliency and decentralization for web apps and dApps, and support for larger blocks to enhance compatibility for pre-existing content addressed data.

Meanwhile, libp2p, serving as the networking stack of web3 and integral to projects like IPFS, Filecoin, Ethereum Beacon Chain, and Polkadot, has made significant strides since 2022. With announcements of the [libp2p foundation](https://protocol.ai/blog/advancing-ipfs-and-libp2p-governance/), core fund, and an independent engineering team, along with the release of js-libp2p 1.0 and experimental support for http-p2p, the stack has solidified its position as a cornerstone of decentralized protocols. The community is also still growing, with over 321,000 unique libp2p nodes per month, and the [libp2p Day 2023](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLX9e-uG608s_46AUVlGya0LZza058ofR4) event that brought together eight community speakers to share insights.

In 2024, the libp2p roadmap aims to further establish the foundation and adjust the funding and structure, address major open issues for robust browser connectivity, and prioritize community and contributor activation. As both IPFS and libp2p continue to shape the decentralized web, community members, enthusiasts, and developers are encouraged to explore these advancements, engage in discussions, and contribute to the ongoing progress.

### Drand

The year has been a very busy one for the [drand](https://drand.love/) team and the League of Entropy! Our drand nodes have indeed served over 60 billion (60,000,000,000 !) requests for randomness in the past 12 months while maintaining a 100% uptime as a distributed threshold network, just as it should be expected to. With 15 distributed key generation and resharing ceremonies, the League of Entropy has grown from running just a “default” beacon chain on both its Testnet and Mainnet networks to running two beacon chains with different frequencies (30s and 3s) on both networks. The League of Entropy also grew from 17 partners to now 21 partners, with more and more organizations joining the effort to provide free, unbiased, verifiable, public randomness as a public good for anyone to use. 

Meanwhile, the drand team also attended nine different events and organized two summits to continue our ongoing effort to spread the word about drand, provide the best DevEx possible when using it, as well as sensibilize smart contract developers to the importance of using proper, unbiased and unpredictable randomness on-chain.

We have also new applications built using drand on all the networks who support drand currently, from Filecoin, to Sui, to Cosmos (through the Nois network) and the team is busy trying to bring BLS pre-compiles to both FVM and the EVM in order to reduce the gas costs of on-chain verification on both Filecoin and Ethereum. So, expect some more Ethereum-related drand news in 2024!  To follow along with the project, check out the [drand blog](https://drand.love/blog/) or the [@drand_loe](https://twitter.com/drand_loe) twitter account, or if you can’t wait to use drand in your codebases, check the drand [Github repos](https://github.com/drand/).

## Filecoin Roadmap - What’s Ahead for 2024

![](/uploads/Screenshot-2024-01-29-at-11.02.36-AM.webp)

2024 feels like Spring - and Filecoin has a massive growth trajectory in store! Here are just a few of the many exciting breakthroughs in store for Filecoin in 2024.

1. **New high-value applications & compute L2s building on Filecoin**: With [InterPlanetary Consensus (IPC)](http://ipc.space/) coming to Filecoin mainnet in 2024, we expect to see the rise of Filecoin L2s - especially those building on the massive storage, compute, and infrastructure strength of Filecoin.
   - Expect to see the first Filecoin L2 compute networks going to mainnet (like [Fluence](https://fluence.network) and [Lilypad](https://docs.lilypad.tech/lilypad/)), the first Filecoin-powered Lambda networks ([Filecoin Station](https://www.filstation.app)), the first retrieval markets ([Filecoin Saturn](https://saturn.tech)), and more! 
   - Especially with the proliferation of generative AI and compute networks specialized for ML inference and training - we expect to see many more specialized compute networks harnessing Filecoin data storage along with [FVM](https://fvm.filecoin.io) and IPC building blocks. 
   - All of these L2s will flow more utility, storage usage, collateral demands and transaction volume back to Filecoin mainnet. 
   - IPC subnets are designed to be highly interoperable - so each new subnet will bring new capabilities and superpowers to the entire Filecoin network as a whole - along with growing their own communities, tokens, and applications building on Filecoin L1.
   - These L2s will also utilize new breakthrough capabilities in FVM - like harnessing custom WASM actors and new runtimes to drive new high quality games, compute systems, and more.
2. **Filecoin as the fundamental storage layer for web3**: Filecoin has already seen massive growth in data storage in 2023, surpassing 1.8 EiB of data stored from thousands of unique clients! In 2024, we’ll see Filecoin become an even more integral part of building in web3 - from becoming the storage layer for all blockchain state, to DePIN network infra data, to smart contract data.
   - With the proliferation of rollups, DA layers, and more - the total volume of chain state is \*exploding\* across web3. In 2024, we expect to see more and more blockchains and DePIN networks follow Solana’s lead and store their full archival chain state in Filecoin for cheaper and more verifiable long-term storage and easier access for dapps, smart contracts, and node operators.
   - The launch of the [Filecoin Virtual Machine](https://fvm.filecoin.io) last year unlocked new programmable storage tooling like automated storage and repair contracts. With the addition of IPC and fast finality unlocking seamless bridging and cross-chain interop, we’ll see new L2 data aggregation networks come online to automate and scale data onboarding to Filecoin - making it easier and faster for any web3 dev or project to store data on Filecoin. 
   - With these building blocks, many more paid data onboarding tools will emerge focused on serving rollups, data availability services, and L1 blockchains with efficient, decentralized, on-chain-native state storage. 
   - The overall growth of chain state during this next cycle will drive more applications to choose low-cost, decentralized storage on Filecoin as their state archival solution (currently an $791.52B market dominated by Infura, Alchemy, and in some especially centralized cases AWS).
   - This will integrate Filecoin more tightly with many other blockchain ecosystems like Ethereum, Solana, Cosmos, and more - so that any web3 dev can use Filecoin to retrieve historical data for analysis, applications, and more across each of these ecosystems.
   - DePIN networks will also harness Filecoin to ensure their critical infrastructure data on local weather conditions, city maps, or wifi routers are well integrated with on-chain data and state. [Tableland](https://tableland.xyz) is already [leading the way here](https://mirror.xyz/tableland.eth/CbRLSRYYClTB8bNOph-1z9WkFvHzBs5MIImPu-ybwAs) in collaboration with [WeatherXM](https://weatherxm.com)!
3. **Filecoin for hot data with fast retrievals**: More high-power applications and paying storage customers will drive up the demand for fast, reliable retrieval of data stored in Filecoin. In 2023, Filecoin built the tooling (boost + IPNI + FilPlus reputation) and measurement systems (SPARK + Station) for large-scale retrieval incentives. In 2024, we’ll see reliable retrieval become the standard for Filecoin storage clients - enhancing Filecoin utility and scope.
   - The [SPARK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDWz3DTnOYI) retrieval monitoring system launched in November 2023, and has been collecting decentralized metrics on Filecoin data retrievability at scale through the [Station](https://www.filstation.app) network. In 2024, we’ll see these retrieval metrics get integrated into Fil+ datacap approvals and incentives for retrieval providers through new [Filecoin Plus](https://filplus.storage) allocators, tying the loop on retrieval incentives full circle. SPARK has completed over 660 million jobs to date.
   - Projects like [Tableland](https://tableland.xyz), [web3.storage](https://web3.storage), [Banyan](https://www.banyan.computer), and others have been building out hot storage offerings on top of Filecoin - enabling S3-like use cases to sit on top of the Filecoin network! These new layers allow for Filecoin as an ecosystem to replace more parts of the infrastructure stack.
4. **DeFi on Filecoin grows**: Filecoin is unique in that it has core economic flows as a part of its economy. While 2023 saw massive growth in the demand for Filecoin collateral via protocols like ([GLIF](https://www.glif.io/en) and stFIL), we expect to see new use cases emerge as builders start leveraging the FVM to pull more capital flows on-chain (e.g. payments for storage deals, compute services, retrieval jobs, and many more).

## Conclusion

In 2023, Filecoin underwent a transformative journey, evolving beyond a decentralized storage network to a programmable platform for enable open data services. This year saw remarkable community growth and technological advancements, with events like FILJakarta, the FIL Dev Summits, and initiatives like Filecoin Orbit and the TL;DR platform playing key roles in community engagement. As we look towards 2024, Filecoin is set to further revolutionize the decentralized web with new applications, compute L2s, and a focus on becoming the fundamental storage layer for web3. Integrating with various blockchain ecosystems and enhancing data retrieval, Filecoin is poised to continue its growth, reinforcing its pivotal role in shaping a more open and interconnected digital world. Looking forward to building this bright future alongside you all!
