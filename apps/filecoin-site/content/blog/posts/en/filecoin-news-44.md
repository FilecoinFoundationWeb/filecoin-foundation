### A Public Goods Experiment on Filecoin: Retroactively Funding Impact with Quadratic Voting

The Protocol Labs Network Goods team launched the Filecoin Community PR program as a focused experiment to retroactively reward contributions to public goods within Protocol Labs. The goal was to test Quadratic Voting as part of a broader strategy to formalize [retroactive impact evaluation](https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/retroactive-public-goods-funding-33c9b7d00f0c) as a scalable method to fund and incentivize development of public goods in the Protocol Labs ecosystem. [Read along](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/a-public-goods-experiment-on-filecoin-retroactively-funding-impact-with-quadratic-voting/) to learn about the results.

### Content Addressing, Persistent Storage, and the Metaverse

Read HQ Han’s opinion on how content addressing and persistent storage can play an important role in preventing the metaverse from becoming a nightmare. The capabilities of IPFS and Filecoin could play a key role in ensuring privacy and true ownership of metaverse assets. They could also make sure that the data that is needed to render the metaverse is stored on decentralized infrastructure and is censorship-resistant.

### Understanding Filecoin Data Aggregators for Storage Providers

The Filecoin ecosystem has an expansive set of tools that are designed to provide accurate information about the network and let participants be active in more effective ways. Many of these are independently developed and maintained by the community and serve the specific needs of different components of the Filecoin island economy. For Storage Providers, analytics and data aggregation are important resources. Find out how to make the best use of them on the Filecoin [blog](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/understanding-filecoin-data-aggregators-for-storage-providers/).
