## ✨ Highlights ✨

### 📊 Filecoin Ecosystem Metrics Roundup: A Data-Driven Foundation for Growth

The Filecoin ecosystem has launched the first [Ecosystem Metrics Roundup](/blog/posts/filecoin-ecosystem-metrics-roundup-building-a-data-driven-foundation-for-growth/), a monthly series aligning the community around the metrics that matter most for sustainable growth. With the network shifting focus from supply bootstrapping to real-world demand, this series breaks down key data—daily onboarding, active clients, paid deals, and total value transacted—to track health and guide decisions. Backed by recent protocol upgrades like Fast Finality and Proof of Data Possession, the Filecoin ecosystem is doubling down on transparency, client demand, and verifiable storage at scale. [Dive in](/blog/posts/filecoin-ecosystem-metrics-roundup-building-a-data-driven-foundation-for-growth/) to read about the current state of the network, actionable next steps, and more.

### 🌠 How Cornell Astrophysicist Uses Ramo to Store the Universe on Filecoin

When Dr. Drummond Fielding, an astrophysicist at Cornell, needed to store petabytes of data from his interstellar gas simulations, he turned to Ramo Cloud—a network that preserves massive research outputs on Filecoin’s decentralized storage.
