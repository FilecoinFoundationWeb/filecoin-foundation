**Community Caution**: The Protocol Labs, IPFS and Filecoin teams are thrilled about the activity coming from communities around the world, including China and Hong Kong. Over the past year, we’ve enjoyed receiving open-source contributions from several community volunteers across China and Hong Kong. We’ve been happy about the many educational events, webcasts, meetups, articles about our projects, and more.

However, we have been warned of unsanctioned individuals and organizations that wrongly claimed to be participating in miner testing for a Filecoin ‘testnet’. **We are directly warning our community in China and Hong Kong that these claims are false. We do not yet have a Filecoin testnet program, and we have not yet been working with any miners.** Any information or updates related to a Filecoin testnet will be published on the Filecoin official [blog](https://filecoin.io/blog/).

Further, Protocol Labs, IPFS, and Filecoin are currently not involved in any partnerships, sponsorships, joint venture, or endorsement agreements with any partners in China or Hong Kong. To date, Protocol Labs, IPFS, and Filecoin have not partnered with any community members, miners, miner machine manufacturers, exchanges, wallets, software developers, technology leaders or technology evangelists in China or Hong Kong. **We strongly recommend to avoid anyone that claims to be commercially or officially affiliated with our teams in those areas at this time.**

We do sometimes correspond with volunteer open-source community members, but these relationships are informal. Any and all information or announcements related to future partnerships, affiliations, sponsorships, joint ventures, endorsement agreements, or a Filecoin testnet will be published on the Filecoin official [blog](https://filecoin.io/blog/). **We do not endorse any information published about Protocol Labs, IPFS, or Filecoin on other media or social channels. Please only look to our official websites and blogs for** [**Protocol Labs**](https://protocol.ai/blog/)**,** [**IPFS**](https://blog.ipfs.tech/)**, and** [**Filecoin**](https://filecoin.io/blog/) **for information about our projects.**

Thank you for your continued support.

Protocol Labs  
Filecoin Team
