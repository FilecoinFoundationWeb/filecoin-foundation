### üìë State of Filecoin 2024 by Filecoin TLDR

Key developments across Filecoin‚Äôs core pillars in 2023 has set the stage for continued expansion in 2024. The FVM launch opened Filecoin‚Äôs economy to new use cases, from easing on-chain payments to improving access to collateral markets, propelling TVL to breach the $200M mark. This momentum is expected to continue with new themes emerging across storage markets, compute and DeFi activity. Foundational improvements (fast finality, customizable subnets, and hot storage) are drawing closer synergies with Compute, AI, and other DePIN networks while teams like Banyan, Seal and Steeldome are pillaring Web2 Enterprise Adoption.
