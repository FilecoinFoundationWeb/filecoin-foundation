Last week, the Filecoin team hosted our very first Filecoin virtual community meetup! Thank you to all who attended and made it such a success. Our community meetups are an opportunity to meet the people behind the many tools and projects being built in the Filecoin ecosystem. On June 16th we were joined by Ian Darrow who spoke about [Filecoin’s testnet incentives](https://filecoin.io/blog/announcing-testnet-incentives/) and Michelle Lee who taught us how to create unstoppable ecosystems. We also had the opportunity to hear from Andrew Hill, founder and CEO of Textile, who gave us an update on Powergate; an API driven solution for deploying multitiered storage across Filecoin and IPFS. If you missed this week’s Filecoin community meetup, you can watch the recordings here:
