LongHash Ventures has just announced the launch of the Filecoin Frontier Accelerator, a 12 week program to fuel the growth of major projects on the world’s largest decentralized storage network. LongHash Ventures is a recognized blockchain accelerator with a global network established across key technological hubs including Singapore, Shanghai, and Hong Kong.

Projects accepted to the Accelerator will receive an upfront grant of $20,000 USD and will also be considered for further funding opportunities of US $1 million investment or more, of which $500,000 is committed by Fenbushi Capital, the first blockchain-focused venture capital firm in Asia.

“Filecoin’s core value proposition as a decentralized storage network exemplifies how blockchain continues to solve practical, real world pain points. Having worked with over 100 leading blockchain projects and multiple protocol communities over the years, we look forward to replicating our success with Filecoin’s ecosystem to promote growth in a healthy and sustainable manner.” - Bo Shen, General Partner at Fenbushi Capital.

Filecoin Frontier Accelerator welcomes projects who drive development and adoption for Web 3.0 to contribute to the Filecoin platform, including infrastructure providers, middleware solutions, and user applications across the technology stack. Over the span of 12 weeks, shortlisted projects will be provided with end-to-end support in areas including strategy formulation, go-to-market execution, technological mentorship, marketing, and fundraising. The program has already onboarded notable mentors from UNICEF Ventures, HashKey Digital Asset Group and NGC Ventures.

The Filecoin Frontier Accelerator is now accepting applications through November 15, with the program set to take place in February 2021.
