## SnarkPack v2: A New Version of Filecoin’s Proof Aggregator

In the recent [Filecoin Network Upgrade](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/filecoin-v16-network-upgrade-skyr/), a new version of the SnarkPack proof aggregation library was released. SnarkPack is a cryptographic protocol to aggregate and verify multiple proofs at the same time in an efficient manner. The Filecoin protocol uses the SnarkPack library on the [Proofs-of-Replication](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/what-sets-us-apart-filecoin-s-proof-system/) that makes those promises possible on the Filecoin network. [Learn more](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/snarkpack-v2-a-new-version-of-filecoin-s-proof-aggregator/) about the improvements in the v2 implementation.

## Rarible Adds Extra Resiliency to NFTs with IPFS and Filecoin via NFT.Storage

As one of the most popular NFT marketplaces, Rarible has always made NFT content available through public IPFS nodes for its users to ensure that they’re always available on the decentralized web. The platform is now partnering with [NFT.Storage](https://nft.storage/) to make use of Filecoin’s permanent storage capabilities. All Rarible NFT content will now be preserved on both IPFS and Filecoin. Read the [announcement](https://blog.ipfs.tech/2022-07-21-rarible-and-nftstorage/) to find out more.

## Sustainable Blockchain Summit Recap

The Filecoin community, along with [Filecoin Green](https://green.filecoin.io), Solana, Gitcoin, Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance, and more, met in Paris on the heels of EthCC. Speakers including Alan Ransil, Juan Benet, and Kristeen Harrison discussed different aspects of blockchain and its sustainable alignment with the natural world. If you’d like to catch up on topics like Green Public Goods or Decarbonizing Supply Chains, then don’t miss this [playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_0VrY55uV1-aOHhYyQwZnoRnQwzjH2Ss).

## Encryption and Access Control for Web3 using Lighthouse

[Lighthouse](https://www.lighthouse.storage/) is a permanent file storage protocol that enables perpetual storage for files using Filecoin and IPFS on the distributed web. However, until now most of the data stored is public and can be accessed by anyone. That’s why Lighthouse chose to build an encryption layer and access control for users to store private and sensitive data on Filecoin using BLS threshold cryptography. Be sure to [learn more](https://www.lighthouse.storage/) about this new tool and how it can help you store data permanently and privately.

## RSK Meetup in Nigeria

Additionally, RSK hosted the first ever Web3 meetup in Port Harcourt, Nigeria, with special participation from the Filecoin Orbit community. The event gathered community managers, product and web developers, blockchain experts, consultants and enthusiasts, and covered how Filecoin storage can support the work done on the RSK blockchain with decentralized storage. Chukwuemeka Mbaebie Enoch also led a campaign to recruit local Filecoin Orbit ambassadors.

## How Does the Network Indexer Work

Filecoin stores a great deal of data, but without proper indexing, clients can’t perform efficient retrieval. Earlier this year, Protocol Labs launched the first production Network Indexer to enable searching for content-addressable data available from storage providers. To improve Filecoin content discoverability, Indexer nodes are developed to store mappings of CID multi-hashes to content provider records. Found out how it works on the [Filecoin blog](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/how-does-the-network-indexer-work/).
