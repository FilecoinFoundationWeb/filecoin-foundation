### **Network v19 Lightening and nv20 Thunder**

In light of the recent degraded chain quality on mainnet, [an expedited nv19 upgrade has been proposed](https://github.com/filecoin-project/core-devs/discussions/123#discussioncomment-5642909) to roll out the market cron mitigation [FIP0060](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0060.md) that will improve block validation times, and hopefully further improve the degraded chain quality currently. We need the community’s support to ensure an expedited but smooth network upgrade, please see below for the key changes and important dates:

- nv19 upgrade on mainnet is moved up from May 11th to April 27th - So that the improvement can be delivered to the network and node operators 10 days sooner.
- Core devs have decided to postpone the activation epoch fixes and [FIP0052 - Extend sector/deal max duration to 3.5 year.](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0052.md) to a later network upgrade.
- By descoping these changes we can greatly de-risk the network upgrade itself by removing a heavy migration that could cause instability for storage providers and node operators during the network upgrade.
- Increase the rollover period for [FIP0061](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0052.md) from 1 week to 3 weeks on mainnet. The rollover period is the duration between nv19 and nv20 which both old proofs (v1) and the new proofs (v1_1) proofs will be accepted by the network.

Please refer to the [implementation announcement channel](https://filecoinproject.slack.com/archives/C01AC6999KQ/p1681830405088089) in Slack for release timelines. For more details, please see the [community discussion](https://github.com/filecoin-project/community/discussions/74#discussioncomment-5376097) in GitHub. Thank you in advance for your understanding and cooperation!

### **FEVM + Brave Wallet**

The Filecoin EVM (FEVM) — the Ethereum virtual machine virtualized as a runtime on top of FVM — is [now a pre-loaded network on Brave Wallet](https://twitter.com/brave/status/1643717569340227586?s=20)’s latest desktop release (v1.50). This runtime environment makes it easier for developers to port their EVM smart contracts to the Filecoin network and start taking advantage of the FVM’s capabilities. Brave Wallet users can now jump straight into the network and its evolving ecosystem of web3 applications based on decentralized storage.

### **State of Filecoin Q1 2023**

Messari recently shared its quarterly analysis on the Filecoin network. Some key insights include a 105% QoQ growth in storage utilization and a 75% QoQ growth in active deals — a part of which came from a 14% increase in daily new deals. The report also takes a look at the impact that the FVM launch has had on the network and web3 as a whole as well as how its roll out has progressed. It concludes that the growth in onboarding and the next-generation applications enabled by the FVM can position Filecoin as a “prominent provider of decentralized storage and cloud services for Web3 and traditional applications.” [Read the report](https://messari.io/report/state-of-filecoin-q1-2023?utm_medium=organic_social&utm_source=twitter_mihaigrigore&utm_campaign=state_of_filecoin_q1_2023) and share your own conclusions with the community.

### **The FVM Imaginarium: Developer Tooling, Hackathons and other Opportunities for Builders**

The [Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM)](http://fvm.dev/) went live on mainnet on March 14th and since, builders have launched everything from [Filecoin pledging and leasing solutions](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/fvm-imaginarium-staking-and-leasing-protocols/) to [token bridging protocols](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/the-fvm-imaginarium-cross-chain-interoperability/). However, we are still just scratching the surface: storage, retrieval and compute applications, which combined are a 300 billion dollar industry, are now more accessible to tap into for Filecoin Ecosystem developers. The FVM enables developers to build a plethora of decentralized applications (dApps) on the Filecoin network and engender a data economy for a wide range of audiences from decentralized data computation services users to Filecoin Storage Providers and clients. [Read this blogpost](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/the-fvm-imaginarium-developer-tooling-hackathons-and-other-opportunities-for-builders/) for an overview of developer tools that will help you get started on your journey building with FVM.

### **FVM Growth: STFIL**

FrogHub is one of the many teams that are building one of the exciting new applications enabled by the FVM. Their project, STFIL, is a decentralized liquidity staking protocol for FIL that connects token holders and Storage Providers in more efficient ways. The protocol recently passed 10K in total FIL locked with the help of their leasing features. Learn more about STFIL, the team behind it, and how they’re growing the Filecoin DeFi ecosystem by visiting their [website](https://www.stfil.io/).

### **Filecoin Bug Bounty Program Now Live on Immunefi**

As announced a few weeks ago, the [Filecoin Bug Bounty Program](https://security.filecoin.io/bug-bounty/) has been refreshed and is now [live on Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/bounty/filecoin/). It features increased rewards up to $500k USD for critical issues and inclusion of programmability features in scope. Post-launch, the community continues to be committed to guaranteeing the security of Filecoin. The network now counts with new and updated components: the FVM, the EVM runtime, and its dependencies. With this update, there is an invitation to security researchers, developers, and bug bunters to help the community identify latent risks and problems that may remain in the codebase after mainnet launch. Learn more about the program, the updated scope, rules and more in this [post](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/refreshing-the-filecoin-bug-bounty-program/).

### **Graph Paper Capital’s GPC1**

### **Web3 Architecture and New Solutions for Carbon Offsets**

Alan Ransil, Filecoin Sustainability Lead, recently explained how leading web3 projects are helping to address the climate crisis with game-changing new tools. From direct payments for carbon offsetting communities to satellite-led deforestation monitoring, these solutions are reframing web3’s role in the fight against climate change. Learn more about these initiatives in Alan’s [Forbes piece](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanransil/2023/04/12/web3-projects-are-rebuilding-carbon-offsets-architecture-of-trust/?sh=278810ce6ec0) and check out what the community is also doing with [Filecoin Green](https://green.filecoin.io/).

### **Indexer Scalability for Ingest-heavy Workload**

There’s a simple strategy to handle index ingestion that requires less syncing and has no need for consensus. It is based on distributing ingestion over a pool of indexers in a way that allows nodes to be added as additional capacity is required. All of this happens without needing to move data around to rebalance storage. Dive into how to apply this strategy — as well as its pros and cons — on the [Filecoin blog](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/indexer-scalability-for-ingest-heavy-workload/).
