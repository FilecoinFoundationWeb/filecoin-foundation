## Announcements

### Announcing FWS

The Engineering team within the Filecoin ecosystem has reached a significant milestone in the Filecoin Web Services project (FWS). FWS is a set of compute and storage technologies built on top of the Filecoin Network that include various components such as computing, storage, and networking resources that can be used by developers to build decentralized applications. These components are designed to be scalable, flexible, and secure, making the offering suitable for a wide range of use cases.

## Community

### FVM Dataverse Hack

The FVM Dataverse Hack is your opportunity to build projects that may potentially become core building blocks in the Filecoin ecosystem: either as products that help end users benefit from the properties of decentralized storage network, or DeFi applications for the Filecoin island economy or developer tools that will potentially help thousands of developers build dApps on FVM in the future. To get started, check out the [FVM Hackathon Cheat sheet](https://github.com/filecoin-project/community/discussions/585), Request for Startups \[FVM edition\], and sign up for the hackathon on [Devpost](https://fvmdataverse.devpost.com/?utm_source=_&utm_medium=_&utm_campaign=fil_slack).

[Watch a full recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTeWO4Ae9EY) of the call on YouTube.

### Waterlily Launches as First Ethical Generative AI Art Platform

[Protocol Labs](https://protocol.ai/), Bacalhau and the [Filecoin Foundation](https://fil.org/) announced the launch of Waterlily, a first-of-its-kind ethical art platform that leverages the Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM) to enable direct coordination and payments to artists whenever their style is used to create generative images. An alternative to existing image generation tools that often exploit styles, images, and likenesses without proper attribution, consent, or payment, Waterlily introduces an ethical generative AI art platform that addresses key issues around attribution, consent, & revenue for creators in the digital space, recognising and rewarding them for their creative works while providing users with ethical image derivatives. Learn more about Waterlily via [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/charliefink/2023/04/27/ai-weekly-replit-raises-97-million-for-ai-coding-hugging-face-takes-aim-at-chatgpt/?sh=5eabf5536be9) and [Silicon Angle](https://siliconangle.com/2023/04/27/new-waterlily-service-offers-ai-image-generation-pays-royalties-artists/) coverage! 

### IPC Subnet support comes to Filecoin Spacenet

[Interplanetary Consensus (IPC)](https://ipc.space/) went live on Spacenet on April 20th, making it possible for builders and users to create FVM-capable, interoperable subnets with fast finality and high throughput. IPC is part of the community’s strategy for providing the network capacity to cope with the influx of FVM applications, as well as enabling use cases that require performance in excess of what the Filecoin root chain can support. [Read the launch blogpost](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/ipc-subnet-support-comes-to-filecoin-spacenet/) for additional pointers and to try out IPC on its road to mainnet deployment later this year.

## Events

### ConsensusDays is back

Consensus is at the heart of blockchain networks but its scalability remains an Achilles' heel. Join us on June 5-6 for the third edition of [ConsensusDays](https://research.protocol.ai/sites/consensusday23/), a virtual workshop focused on the latest research in consensus and adjacent topics. The program for this year counts 20 peer-reviewed contributions plus invited talks from Zarko Milosevic and Aggelos Kiayias. [Get your free ticket now](https://lu.ma/consensusdays23)!

### Funding the Commons, July 15-16

The 6th edition of [Funding the Commons](https://fundingthecommons.io/) will take place on 15-16 July with the beautiful backdrop of Paris, France. This installation of Funding the Commons is timed as the perfect complement to the Ethereum Community Conference, which takes place the following day and just a short walk from the university. Paris will be our key in-person event during 2023 and will be unique in its incorporation of open space technology and other unconference-style programming, in addition to keynote speakers and panel discussions. This format will enable even more connection amongst participants, and lead to the formation of new collaborations and projects. Apply to attend or apply to speak on the [official website](https://fundingthecommons.io/). We look forward to seeing you in Paris!

### Thanks for Joining the Filecoin Community in Austin

Last week, more than 600 people made the Filecoin Network Base in Austin their home base to work, learn, and connect with the Filecoin community. Over three days, the community gathered to discuss the future of gaming, the latest cryptoeconomic research, and updates from across the Filecoin network. Then, Filecoin Foundation presented [Protocol Village at Consensus](https://twitter.com/i/status/1651594753740341248), where developers explored the future of top chains. Were you on the ground in Austin? Drop us a line and tell us about your favorite moment from Consensus week in Austin.
