We’re thrilled to announce the successful completion of the very first [Filecoin Public Goods Funding (ProPGF)](https://fil-propgf.questbook.app/) batch. A total of $3.68M in funding has been allocated to 14 teams building foundational infrastructure, developer tooling, and essential services that will power the next generation of Filecoin applications.

Protocol Labs’ Filecoin Public Goods Funding (PGF) programs support projects that strengthen the Filecoin ecosystem and broader open-source infrastructure. Funding is distributed through ProPGF (prospective funding for forward-looking initiatives) and RetroPGF (retroactive rewards for proven impact), enabling developers, researchers, and community builders to create and sustain tools, protocols, and resources that advance decentralized storage and the open web.

This is just the beginning. ProPGF is designed to be a recurring, long-term initiative, with funding batches taking place every six months. Batch 2 launches this October 2025, and we can’t wait to see what’s next.

## Results at a Glance

- 38 projects applied
- 23 shortlisted for final review
- 14 teams selected for funding
- $3,681,800 allocated

## A Community Effort

This milestone wouldn’t be possible without the time, care, and commitment of our [ProPGF selection committee](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/announcing-the-propgf-selection-committee-members/), who conducted thoughtful reviews and rigorous due diligence to ensure that every dollar supports projects with meaningful impact. A heartfelt thank you to the committee, and to all the teams who applied. Your contributions continue to drive the Filecoin ecosystem forward.

## Final Thoughts

The close of ProPGF Batch 1 marks more than a funding milestone. It’s a testament to the growing strength, ambition, and collaboration within the Filecoin ecosystem.
