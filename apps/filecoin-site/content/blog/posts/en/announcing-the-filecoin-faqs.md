We have assembled an exhaustive list of crowd-sourced [Filecoin FAQs](https://docs.filecoin.io/about-filecoin/faq/) from our active community as a quick and easy resource for questions about Filecoin. The Filecoin FAQs provide clear, high quality responses to popular questions from our community. We believe these FAQs will be useful for a wide range of our audience, whether already familiar with the Filecoin network or not. Please note the Filecoin FAQs will likely evolve over time: we anticipate editing, adding, or removing questions and answers as appropriate. And please keep the questions coming! Our team is delighted to hear from you at [team@filecoin.io](mailto:team@filecoin.io).

Filecoin is only as strong as its community, and we cannot thank you enough for your enthusiasm. We are thrilled you have joined us on the journey to decentralize data storage and access.
