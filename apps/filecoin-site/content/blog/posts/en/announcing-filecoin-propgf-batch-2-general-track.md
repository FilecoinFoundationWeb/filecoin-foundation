We’re excited to announce the General Track of Filecoin ProPGF Batch 2, a $4M milestone-based funding round designed to support the teams building critical open-source infrastructure, research, governance tooling, and user experience improvements across the Filecoin ecosystem.

This round builds on the success of Batch 1 and continues our commitment to fund credible, high-impact work that makes Filecoin more useful, resilient, and aligned with long-term network needs.

Applications are now open on [Karma](https://app.filpgf.io/programs/992/apply) and will remain open until December 23, 2025. We pre-launched this track at FDS 2025 and are now opening it publicly for all eligible teams.

## What We’re Looking For

All projects will be evaluated primarily on their potential to make Filecoin more useful, resilient, and impactful. The following areas illustrate common types of work that advance these goals (but are not exhaustive):

### Core Dependencies for Filecoin

Projects that applied in ProPGF Round 1 and are considered core infrastructure or essential services critical to the network’s reliability, safety, or performance.

### Tooling & Developer Ecosystem

SDKs, APIs, infrastructure, and developer tools that improve Filecoin’s developer experience.

### Research

Technical, economic, or design research that advances the Filecoin protocol or deepens understanding of ecosystem dynamics.

### Customer Success & Adoption

Onboarding pathways, documentation, tutorials, and initiatives that accelerate adoption and ecosystem growth.

### Governance & Coordination

Mechanisms, frameworks, or tools that enhance transparency, decision-making, and collective coordination.

### End-User UX

Interfaces, integrations, and applications that make Filecoin more intuitive and usable for everyday users.

For teams building on Filecoin, please make sure to check out the [Filecoin Ecosystem Metrics Roundup](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/filecoin-ecosystem-metrics-roundup-building-a-data-driven-foundation-for-growth/). These are the key metrics that projects will be evaluated against, so we encourage applicants to design their work to ladder up to these metrics.

## Funding Model: Milestone-Based

All grants under this program are milestone-based, with payouts tied to the completion and verification of approved deliverables. This ensures:

- accountability
- predictable progress
- measurable ecosystem impact

1. Applications Open: November 12 - December 23, 2025
2. Reviews: Rolling basis through the end of January, 2026
3. Funding Decisions Announced: Week of January 30, 2026
