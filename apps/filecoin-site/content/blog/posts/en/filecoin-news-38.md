### The Filecoin Green Website is Live

The Filecoin community is happy to introduce the new dedicated [website](https://green.filecoin.io/) for Filecoin Green. Filecoin Green aims to measure the environmental impacts of Filecoin and verifiably drive them below zero, building infrastructure along the way that allows anyone to make transparent and substantive environmental claims. The new website will keep you updated with blog posts and events as well as the latest developments towards the goal of making Filecoin carbon neutral with other tools such as the [Purchases Repo](https://github.com/redransil/filecoin-renewables-purchases). Stay in the loop and follow Filecoin Green on its official [Twitter](https://twitter.com/filecoingreen) account.

### Hedera Introduces HashAxis Using Filecoin to Store NFTs

[HashAxis](https://hashaxis.com) is a new NFT marketplace built on Hedera that features a scalable and cost-effective way to mint, manage, and trade. It uses the Hedera Token Service to embed native atomic swaps and royalty functionalities into the NFTs while relying on Filecoin and IPFS for the decentralized storage of their content and metadata. Read more about the new tool and how it leverages the network via [Estuary](https://estuary.tech/) on the [official website](https://hedera.com/users/hashaxis) for the project.

### A Deep Dive into the Storage Provider Ecosystem

The Filecoin Network is supported by an expanding ecosystem of Storage Providers who currently provide over 15 EiB in committed capacity. Spreading across the globe, it consists of small and individual setups as well as large and enterprise-focused participants. If you’d like to learn more about this community and all the tools to get you started as a storage provider, be sure to check out an [in-depth exploration](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/a-deep-dive-into-the-storage-provider-ecosystem/) on the Filecoin blog.

### Myel, CDNs, and the Filecoin Retrieval Market

Content Delivery Networks are an essential part of providing internet users with better access to content. However, they have serious limitations in terms of security, costs, and geographical reach. A new generation of CDNs is resorting to Filecoin to provide more efficient and decentralized alternatives to these services. [Read more](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/cdns-and-the-filecoin-retrieval-market/) on what projects like Myel are doing to allow anyone to easily set up a point-of-presence (POP) for decentralized CDNs.
