  Filecoin and Polygon Studios Deepen Collaboration in NFTs, Games, and the
  Metaverse
_template: blog_detail
---

The Filecoin ecosystem and [Polygon Studios](https://polygonstudios.com/) are delighted to announce a collaboration to drive growth in the non-fungible token (NFT), games, and metaverse space. To kickstart the collaboration, the two ecosystems have developed tutorials, integration grants, and hackathons aimed at helping developers and NFT projects in the [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) network to integrate with InterPlanetary File System ([IPFS](https://ipfs.tech/)) and [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io/).

Originally conceived as a secure Layer 2 solution to address pain points like high gas fees and slow block validation times on popular blockchains like Ethereum, Polygon has gained traction with blockchain game developers and NFT projects. To cater to this growing segment, Polygon Studios was launched with the goal of incubating and supporting Web 3.0-powered game developers, and NFT projects.

Similarly, a growing number of projects in the play-to-earn (P2E) and NFT space have also chosen to use IPFS for [content addressing](https://blog.ipfs.tech/2021-04-05-storing-nfts-on-ipfs/) and Filecoin for [provable and decentralized storage](https://blog.ipfs.tech/2021-06-03-ipfs-filecoin-content-persistence/) to store metadata with rich media such as videos.

## Combining Filecoin’s durability and Polygon’s scalability opens new use cases for developers

In August 2021, we [announced](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/announcing-filecoin-polygon-bridge-and-free-storage-for-developers/) that Polygon would offer free storage costs for projects looking to build on the [Filecoin-Polygon bridge](https://eth.storage/docs#ethereum--polygon-bridge-to-filecoin) developed by the [Textile](https://www.textile.io/) team. The bridge enables developers and Polygon application users to easily store data from any Polygon address on the IPFS network without any new signups, secrets, or API keys.

Filecoin and Polygon also jointly-organized the [Mars Hackathon](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/about-500-000-in-prizes-and-grants-for-asia-hackathon-season-2021/), which ran from August to November 2021. The virtual hackathon saw more than 1,500 developers coming together to build new applications using the Filecoin-Polygon bridge, including use cases like storage, the metaverse, entertainment, digital art, and more.

Notable projects from the hackathon included [Blockspace](https://airtable.com/appPrImBw9ntRgY88/tblCwc1GeUbvwVrmU/viwsPcyqiucf24e1j/reckvUASFD2LclsGY?blocks=hide), a decentralized file storage and sharing platform built on top of IPFS that mirrors traditional cloud providers like Google Drive, and [Slick](https://airtable.com/appPrImBw9ntRgY88/tblCwc1GeUbvwVrmU/viwsPcyqiucf24e1j/recKvMw34LuRJuY3T?blocks=hide), a decentralized alternative to Patreon.

## $5,000 grants for eligible Polygon projects integrating IPFS and Filecoin

Projects in the Polygon ecosystem that are integrating with IPFS and Filecoin (and services like NFT.storage, Estuary, Web3.storage, Filecoin-Polygon Bridge) are eligible for a $5,000 grant.

Eligible projects can apply [here](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/blob/master/Program%20Resources/Microgrants%20README.md)! Applications are reviewed on a rolling basis, so early submissions are encouraged.

Grant-funded projects will also have the opportunity to join future acceleration programs, and connect to technical, product, and other potential resources of support from both ecosystems.
