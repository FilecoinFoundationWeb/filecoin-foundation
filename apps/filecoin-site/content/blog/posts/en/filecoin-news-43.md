## Announcements

### Funding the Commons is Coming to NYC

Public goods are a cornerstone of building open networks and the future of the web. Funding public goods is an ongoing opportunity, and one in which many across the Web 2.0 and Web3 space are involved. In November 2021 and March 2022, Protocol Labs hosted Funding the Commons events to bring these builders and thought leaders together to map the future of public goods. This June, Funding the Commons is back IRL in NYC! Join the community June 24-25 on the heels of NFT.NYC. Early bird tickets are available — [scoop them up now](https://fundingthecommons.io/)..

### Another Round of Grants for New Storage Providers

Last month, the Filecoin Storage Provider Mentorship Grants Program was announced. The program offered 10 qualified storage providers 10 hours of free consulting to kickstart their Filecoin storage provider operations. The 10 storage provider slots were almost immediately filled, and demand has remained high. More consulting grants are now available for qualified storage providers along three tracks: Orientation, Retainer, and Build. [Learn more about each option and how to apply](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/new-filecoin-storage-provider-mentorship-grants-fspm-available/).

### Ecosystem Highlight: Estuary

If you’ve been around the Filecoin community, you’ve probably heard of [Estuary](https://estuary.tech). Estuary is an open source data storage service built on Filecoin and IPFS. Estuary ensures data durability by storing data replicas as many as six times on Filecoin. In this breakdown, learn how Estuary powers much of the data on Filecoin, and helps users around the world more effectively realize the opportunity of decentralized storage. Read ‘[Estuary is a Boon to All Filecoin Users’](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/estuary-is-a-boon-to-all-filecoin-users/).

### Gitcoin Grants Round 14

Protocol Labs is hosting a Gitcoin Grants Matching Round from June 8 to June 23 to help fund public and network goods using quadratic funding. We are especially excited to see projects focusing on infrastructure related to Web3 data, storage, and connectivity. [Submit](https://gitcoin.co/grants/new) your project now and let others know about this funding opportunity.

### What is the Metaverse… to Protocol Labs

Jonas Jetschni and HQ Han from Protocol Labs break down how they think of the ‘metaverse’ — where it’s going, what it means to “arrive”, and how to get there. The metaverse, they believe, “will consist of interconnected spaces in which humans interact with a sense of presence, and will enjoy experiences and applications.” The best way to get there is to understand the “layers” that make up the entire metaverse, and where critical solutions like Filecoin and IPFS fit in. Dive in and join Jonas and HQ on their musings of the metaverse: [How We Think About the Metaverse](https://medium.com/allthingsweb-blog/how-we-think-about-the-metaverse-374085b9e90).

## Tools

### Tools for Building the Metaverse

To build a secure and decentralized metaverse for the future, we must build on resilient and reliable infrastructure. The Filecoin stack is open, enabling developers anywhere in the world to build towards the vision of the metaverse and the storage demands it requires. Announcing the launch of the Metaverse by the Filecoin stack — a home for the entire Filecoin community to build the future of the open metaverse together.

### Bringing Decentralized Storage to Space

The Filecoin Foundation (FF) and aerospace company Lockhead Martin are working together to bring IPFS to space. The collaboration is aimed at building out the underlying infrastructure of the rapidly-emerging space economy — the inevitable development of a private, independent economy away from earth. By minimizing the number of times that data has to be transmitted to Earth and returned to space, IPFS’s decentralized storage model will enable more efficient data transfer and communication.
