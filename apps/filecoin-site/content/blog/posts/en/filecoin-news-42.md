## Project Bacalhau is Reinventing Science with Open Collaborative Computing

One of the biggest challenges in Big Data today is how to process growing datasets efficiently and quickly while managing costs. A project codenamed Bacalhau is taking on this challenge to bring data processing to the nodes where it is stored on Filecoin and give researchers and data engineers the ability to publicly reproduce data pipelines. Learn more about the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/filecoin-project/bacalhau) and [reach out](https://forms.gle/roiz5spfKBtNUbXU6) to the team if you’re part of the scientific community and would like to provide feedback. You can also join the Bacalhau community’s Slack channels [#bacalhau](https://filecoinproject.slack.com/archives/C02RLM3JHUY) and [#bacalhau-scientific-community](https://filecoinproject.slack.com/archives/C03DXJNMMK2).
