## ‚ú® Highlights ‚ú®

### FIL Dev Summit is back in Brussels this summer

Join us at the upcoming [FIL Dev Summit](https://www.fildev.io/FDS-4), set for July 9-11, 2024, in the heart of Brussels at the Radisson, Grand Place. This vital summit brings together developers, innovators, and enthusiasts from the Filecoin community to dive deep into the future of decentralized storage technology. Whether you're looking to enhance your technical skills, contribute to the Filecoin protocol, or engage in transformative discussions, FDS is your gateway to advancing the blockchain frontier. A select number of early bird tickets are available at 50% off now through May 9th, [grab yours now](https://lu.ma/FDS-4)! Plus check out the [event website](https://www.fildev.io/FDS-4) for a peek at the schedule.

### The Nv22 Dragon Upgrade is complete

After several months of planning and iteration, Filecoin nv22 Dragon upgrade has launched on mainnet, a pivotal development in the network's progression. This upgrade marks a notable transition as it's the first to occur under our new prescheduled upgrade structure.

The nv22 Dragon upgrade introduces a suite of improvements and changes aimed at enhancing the network's efficiency, reliability, and user experience. Furthermore, this upgrade brings together a set of strategic enhancements to refine the network's operational dynamics. Notably, the upgrade enhances network security and integrity through the adoption of a more robust randomness source, improving the reliability and predictability of the network. Additionally, it introduces a shift towards manual deal settlement, providing Storage Providers with increased control and flexibility in managing deal payments. This change is instrumental in reducing the computational burden on the network, thereby enhancing its scalability.

### Just released: Messari‚Äôs State of Filecoin Q1 2024

Messari recently released the [Filecoin Q1'24 report](https://messari.io/report/state-of-filecoin-q1-2024?utm_medium=organic_social&utm_source=twitter_messari&utm_campaign=state_of_filecoin_q1_2024) revealing growth in both the Filecoin storage market and DeFi ecosystem. Active deals increased by 9% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ), with 23% of storage capacity utilized. Over 2,000 clients have onboarded data on Filecoin, including 508 handling large datasets, up from 465 in Q4'23. The [Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM)](http://fvm.filecoin.io/) ecosystem also expanded, with over 3,400 unique contracts deployed. Besides growing the FVM ecosystem, the ecosystem is focusing on increasing enterprise adoption in the near term, and on developing DePIN partnerships to leverage idle compute in the longer term.

### Fast PoRep: Accelerating Filecoin's Retrieval Market

A new FIP introduces "Fast PoRep," a mechanism designed to facilitate faster retrieval from the Filecoin network by offering a second type of proof. This proof reduces the number of SDR layers or employs other mechanisms, improving sealing and unsealing speed while requiring a higher initial pledge per unit of storage to maintain security. The proposal aims to address Filecoin's current retrieval delays and make the network more usable, balancing security and performance, and supporting various storage providers with different PoRep options.
