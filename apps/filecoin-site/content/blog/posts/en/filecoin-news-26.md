## The Filecoin Network Surpasses 10 EiB of Storage Capacity

Eleven months after mainnet launch, the Filecoin network is celebrating a major milestone. As of last week, the global community of Filecoin storage providers has dedicated over 10 exbibytes (EiB) of decentralized storage capacity to the Filecoin network. 10EiB is equivalent to 190 Internet Archives, 45,000 Wikipedias, and 6,850,000 years worth of video calls! This is a tremendous achievement for the Filecoin community.

## Taking a Look at Estuary

The Filecoin network is a breakthrough in decentralized storage network infrastructure and protocols. There are many storage solutions on the internet but few are as advanced as Filecoin with regards to decentralization and transparency. Now, with Estuary, there is an open-source stack for the community to use freely for storing public data on Filecoin. Want to learn more? Check out this [**blog post**](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/taking-a-look-at-estuary/) on how to get started.

## Introducing DataStation

Storage providers are at the heart of [**Filecoin**](https://filecoin.io/)’s decentralized storage network, which is why [**BUIDL Labs**](https://buidllabs.io/) has created **DataStation**, a platform that focuses on storage providers’ information and aims to provide quantitative and qualitative data about storage providers in an easy to understand manner. DataStation will also provide users with a more simplified way to choose a Storage Provider according to their specific needs. Learn more about what is in it for the users and how DataStation works in [**this post**](https://medium.com/buidl-labs/datastation-enhancing-the-experience-of-decentralised-storage-on-filecoin-79e8807b854d).
