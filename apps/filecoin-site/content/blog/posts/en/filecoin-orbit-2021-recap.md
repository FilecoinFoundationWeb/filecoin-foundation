  Filecoin Orbit 2021 Recap: Celebrating the One Year Anniversary of Mainnet
  Liftoff
_template: blog_detail
---

[Filecoin Orbit 2021](https://orbit.filecoin.io/) celebrated the first anniversary of the [Filecoin mainnet launch](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/filecoin-mainnet-is-live/) on October 18-22nd, 2021. For one week, the global Filecoin community gathered at conferences, workshops, and meetups — both virtual and IRL — held across the globe, from Italy to China, Nigeria to Japan, and more.

[Juan Benet](https://twitter.com/juanbenet) kicked off Filecoin Orbit with a keynote highlighting the [many achievements](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/filecoin-orbit-filecoin-year-one-in-review/) of the Filecoin community over the past year since Liftoff, including the phenomenal growth in network storage power: “Twelve exbibytes is just a huge amount of storage capacity and this is provided by over three thousand storage providers around the world.”

![Filecoin Orbit 2021: 34 events, 12 countries, 5 continents, 20k+ participants](/uploads/filecoin-orbit-2021-stats.webp "Filecoin Orbit 2021: 34 events, 12 countries, 5 continents, 20k+ participants")

The week was packed with enlightening and informative events, check out the recap below and [head over to the Filecoin Orbit YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_0VrY55uV1_HE_bE-frkYUPGybjYHbNz) for a full list of talks.

## Announcements

### 💻 Filecoin Virtual Machine

Announcing [the Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw9syGiG31c&list=PL_0VrY55uV1_HE_bE-frkYUPGybjYHbNz&index=3)!

“The goal of the Filecoin Virtual Machine is to enable users to deploy their own smart contracts on the Filecoin blockchain,” [Raúl Kripalani](https://twitter.com/raulvk) of Protocol Labs revealed. “There are so many things that can be built on the FVM that we are so excited about. What we really want is to get you thinking about the possibilities here.”

FVM brings general programmability and compatibility with Ethereum Virtual Machine smart contacts to the Filecoin blockchain. Attendees of Filecoin Orbit were among the first in the world to learn about FVM, its vision, the thousands of opportunities that it will unlock, its implementation roadmap, and how to [join the action](https://spec.filecoin.io/intro/filecoin_vm/).

### 📚 Internet Archive

The [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/) was one of the first organizations to grasp the potential of Filecoin and IPFS to store humanity’s most valuable information in a secure and robust manner, and a [collaboration with the Filecoin Foundation to serve that important mission](https://filecoinfoundation.medium.com/the-filecoin-foundation-announces-50-000-fil-grant-to-the-internet-archive-a4f27218e1a2) was announced in April 2020.

At Filecoin Orbit,[Brewster Kahle](https://twitter.com/brewster_kahle), founder of the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/),[noted the importance of archiving knowledge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne_NyqYkQgo&list=PL_0VrY55uV1_HE_bE-frkYUPGybjYHbNz&index=19&t=18s) for generations to come: "We want to make the internet permanent because when the World Wide Web was created, it did not have a structure made for longevity, which is something that Filecoin and the Internet Archive is aiming to solve."

### ✅ The Truth Machine

By integrating [Chainlink](https://chainlinklabs.com/) into the Filecoin ecosystem, a multitude of bidirectional smart contract capabilities emerge that were previously impossible to achieve, such as decentralized oracle networks.

At a fireside chat, Chainlink Co-founder, [Sergey Nazarov](https://twitter.com/SergeyNazarov) discussed those and other new capabilities with Juan Benet, and how cryptographically-verified systems will help solve large-scale global problems.

### 💰 Zcash

Last month, Protocol Labs, [Electric Coin Company](https://electriccoin.co/) (ECC) and the [Ethereum Foundation](https://ethereum.org/en/foundation/) [announced a partnership for R&D into Halo 2](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/reviving-halo-2-with-protocol-labs-filecoin-foundation-ethereum-foundation-and-electric-coin-co/), ECC's recursion system for [Zcash](https://z.cash/). Many know Zcash as a privacy-enhancing cryptocurrency, while Halo 2 is also a marvel of blockchain scalability. In a [Filecoin Orbit keynote panel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4XOdagc9xw), Zcash creator and ECC CEO [Zooko Wilcox](https://twitter.com/zooko) and Filecoin Foundation chair [Marta Belcher](https://twitter.com/martabelcher) talked about extending the Halo zero knowledge proof system and how that new technology can be used.

Zooko also spoke about what web3 meant in terms of privacy: "A lot of people think of privacy as 'secrecy,' but to me, it means consent. You should choose who in your life you share information with. Web3 should enable those to share on their own terms."

### 🖼 NFTs

[OpenSea](https://opensea.io/) was one of the first NFT marketplaces to integrate Filecoin and allow creators to freeze metadata, making NFTs more verifiable and persistent in the long-term.

OpenSea Co-founder and CEO [Devin Finzer](https://twitter.com/dfinzer) gave an [in-depth talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f_vzL2pPP8) and mentioned the benefits of storing NFT metadata with Filecoin: “You know we started to work more closely with IPFS and Filecoin and we really wanted to create an experience for people creating NFTs that would allow them to have permanent storage of their metadata.”

### 👢 Request for Startups

At the start of Filecoin Orbit week, Protocol Labs issued a [far-reaching request for “crypto-native” startups](https://protocol.ai/blog/request-for-startups/), inviting new and current companies to seek support from the Protocol Labs network and join the crypto-native revolution, envisioning a world in which teams building in this space can lean on provided services, leaving them free to focus on the core technical issues they set out to solve.

### 🏛 Filecoin Foundation

In addition to taking part in the sessions on Filecoin Green and Zcash, the rapidly growing [Filecoin Foundation](https://fil.org/) participated in and hosted several other events over the course of Filecoin Orbit. They kicked off with a town hall-style event dedicated to the idea of [governance in Web3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz0phPSFKzA) and how it relates to the Filecoin ecosystem.

### 🥬 Filecoin Green

How can Filecoin storage providers lead the way in building a verifiably environmentally sustainable blockchain? Key stakeholders within the Filecoin ecosystem including Juan Benet, [Filecoin Green](https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/protocol-labs-and-energy-web-complete-first-showcase-of-an-open-source-solution-to-decarbonize-1a8c22ac02f5) project lead [Alan Ransil, PhD](https://twitter.com/rransil), [Radboud University](https://www.ru.nl/english/) Associate Professor of Computer Science [Harald Vranken](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=J3ZE7nEAAAAJ&hl=en), and many others explored this question, and [revealed a path for environmental sustainability in Filecoin](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_0VrY55uV18i8gXWcuVLK3J60cetDP6E).

Juan stated, "Don't settle for zero — Filecoin can and should aim to be 10x green with net carbon emissions of -1,000."

We are planning events, grants and other support to enable Filecoin to become verifiably environmentally beneficial and to track environmental impacts throughout the web. Join #fil-green on Filecoin Slack to be the first to find out about new opportunities or tell us what you think needs to be built in this space on [GitHub](https://github.com/protocol/FilecoinGreen-tools).

### 🌌 Filecoin Project Gravity

Announced a few weeks earlier, Filecoin Orbit presented an opportunity for many more people to learn from Protocol Labs’ Marina Kostioutchenko [about Filecoin Project Gravity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk20s52_9-M&list=PL_0VrY55uV1_HE_bE-frkYUPGybjYHbNz&index=43), a limited-time community referral program in which storage providers who succeed in bringing customers with large datasets onto the Filecoin network can receive FIL awards and helps create a “data gravity pull” effect.

There’s still time to[register in the Filecoin Project Gravity sales referral program](https://protocollabs.typeform.com/to/r4INu5Ud?typeform-source=filecoin.io) by December 1, 2021.

### 🚀 HyperDrive

Just before Filecoin Orbit, [Filecoin mainnet executed its major HyperDrive network upgrade](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/filecoin-v13-hyperdrive-network-upgrade-unlocks-10-25x-increase-in-storage-onboarding/). "HyperDrive unlocks a 10 to 25x increase in network throughput through innovation in underlying technology," noted [ZX](https://twitter.com/zixuanzh) of Protocol Labs in a [Filecoin Orbit session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AS3mpp5-PA&list=PL_0VrY55uV1_HE_bE-frkYUPGybjYHbNz&index=21).

Storage clients and application developers have benefited from increased message throughput, improving overall network utility. But the most notable improvement has been for Filecoin storage providers, who are now benefiting from new economies of scale and faster capacity onboarding rates. These are just some of the advantages HyperDrive has brought to the Filecoin ecosystem.

### 🕊 Starling Lab

[Starling Lab](https://www.starlinglab.org/), jointly developed by the [USC Shoah Foundation](https://sfi.usc.edu/) and [Stanford University’s Department of Electrical Engineering](https://ee.stanford.edu/), was [announced last year](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/starling-lab-establishing-trust-for-humanity-s-data/) as a new framework for combating misinformation, tracing provenance, and reducing information uncertainty across a variety of applications, from news media to historical preservation.

Jonathan Dotan, a fellow at [Stanford's Center for Blockchain Research](https://cbr.stanford.edu/) and the [Stanford Compression Forum](https://compression.stanford.edu/), gave an [update on Starling Lab’s progress](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrEXHGml-bE&list=PL_0VrY55uV1_HE_bE-frkYUPGybjYHbNz&index=33) and its role in the advancement of human rights.

Dotan also called for more diversity and inclusion in open source: “We need to make sure that, as we look at the statistics around open source technology development ecosystems, we take proactive measures to ensure that we can actually have proper inclusion.”

### 🧱 Hackathons

In the past year, there have been more than 30 Filecoin and IPFS hackathons and dozens of amazing projects and applications have been developed. Lukas Bresser of Protocol Labs delivered [highlights from the hackathons this last year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loNmFfCQmqc&list=PL_0VrY55uV1_HE_bE-frkYUPGybjYHbNz&index=16) and announced the recent launch of the [Filecoin Hackathons website](https://fil.org/events/), where information about all ongoing hackathons can be found and future hackathons will be announced!

### 🕸 Web3 Browsers

Over the last year, the integration of browsers with Web3 technology has experienced new milestones, including Filecoin’s and IPFS’ collaborations with [Brave](https://brave.com/ipfs-support/), [Opera](https://blogs.opera.com/tips-and-tricks/2021/02/opera-crypto-files-for-keeps-ipfs-unstoppable-domains/) and several others. “What does it mean now with the advent of NFTS — what are the types of functionality that we can have in a browser that has both your cryptographic identity through its wallet and also you're constantly browsing the cryptographic assets that you are either interacting with communities with or purchased even?” [Dietrich Ayala](https://twitter.com/dietrich) of Protocol Labs and [Anirudha Bose](https://twitter.com/onybose) of Brave [discussed this question and more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rMMEeZ6jI4&list=PL_0VrY55uV1_HE_bE-frkYUPGybjYHbNz&index=38) about the work they and others are efforting to make sure Web3 will have native decentralized storage capabilities in Web3 browsers.
