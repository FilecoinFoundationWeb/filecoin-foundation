Last week was packed with talks, demos, workshops, and more for Filecoin Liftoff Week. We know a lot happened, so we wanted to take a minute to summarize the week‚Äôs highlights, most important announcements, and where you can find more information.

### Announcements

#### ü§ùFilecoin & ConsenSys Partnership

Last week, we announced Protocol Labs‚Äô expanded collaboration with ConsenSys, one of the most trusted software engineering leaders in the Ethereum space. The new collaboration between ConsenSys Labs and Protocol Labs is bringing together the Filecoin and Ethereum ecosystems to drive the next generation of the web. Already, the collaboration has announced Filecoin Storage and Filecoin Defi Bridge from ConsenSys Codefi, [MetaMask‚Äôs Snaps](https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-snaps-beta/wiki), [Infura‚Äôs Filecoin Network API](http://infura.io/), Secondary Retrieval Mining research with ConsenSys R&D, and this past summer‚Äôs Tachyon Launchpad Accelerator.

#### üìÇFilecoin Archive & Recommendations

The [Filecoin Archive](https://twitter.com/juanbenet/status/1319375340196646913) is a collaboration with Filecoin and the Internet Archive project to select important datasets of information and preserve them on the Filecoin network. This community-driven effort needs your help deciding what information to select! Anyone can suggest an idea by tweeting it and tagging #FilecoinArchives. The Internet Archive and Protocol Labs will gather your suggestions, publish the full list, and curate a subset for preservation on the Filecoin network - which then anyone can help replicate. [Learn more](https://twitter.com/juanbenet/status/1319375340196646913).

#### üöÄFilecoin Foundation Launch

Announced this week, the Filecoin Foundation is a board of leaders from the Web3, technology, legal, and activism sectors responsible for the oversight and governance of the Filecoin network. The Filecoin Foundation will work to support and grow the community while stimulating the development of the network. Filecoin Foundation members include Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin, Blockchain Association Executive Director Kristin Smith, Protocol Labs outside counsel Marta Belcher, and Hyperledger Executive Director Brian Behlendorf, and more.

#### üêûBug Bounty Program

We created a program to reward all security researchers, hackers and security aficionados that invest time into finding bugs on the Filecoin protocol and its respective implementations. We invite all security researchers to join us in maintaining the security of the Filecoin Network. [Learn more](https://security.filecoin.io/).

### Filecoin Liftoff Week Resources

All of the talks, demos, panels, and more from last week have been uploaded to the [Filecoin YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPyYmtJYQwxM-EUyRUTp5DA).
