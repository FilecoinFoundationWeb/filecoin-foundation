In light of the ongoing COVID-19 disruption and continued travel restrictions across Asia Pacific, we are postponing FIL-Singapore to late September to ensure we meet the event’s high expectations, which we share with our valued community. The event will now take place September 26-27, at the Marina Bay Sands in Singapore, ahead of TOKEN2049. We understand this change is disruptive for our community members who have made plans to attend the event. Thank you for your flexibility and support. We look forward to seeing you later this year!

## Filecoin v16 Skyr upgrade is here

The Filecoin v16 Skyr upgrade - the deployment of Milestone 1 of the Filecoin Virtual Machine to the Filecoin network was successfully completed on Wednesday, July 6th at 1400 UTC. This upgrade represents the most dramatic transformation of the Filecoin network since its inception nearly two years ago. The centerpiece of this upgrade was [the introduction of the Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM)](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0030.md), and the migration of chain execution to it. The Skyr upgrade is the first of two steps on the path to fully enabling on-chain user programmability on Filecoin, bringing with it the possibility for a boundless number of new use cases and features to be implemented on the already robust network. Learn more about the upgrade and what’s next in the [announcement post](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/filecoin-v16-network-upgrade-skyr/).

## Project Pikachu: Checkpointing Filecoin onto Bitcoin

Protocol Labs Research has opened a new Request for Proposal grant codenamed Project Pikachu. RFP-012 has the goal of building a solution that will enable checkpointing Bitcoin onto Filecoin. This will serve to improve the security of the network by anchoring the state of Filecoin’s Proof-of-Storage blockchain onto Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work mechanism, leveraging the best of both worlds.
