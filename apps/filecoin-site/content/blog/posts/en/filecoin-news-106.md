## ✨ Highlights ✨

### CalibrationNet Upgrade to Network v25 (Teep 🦵) Is Coming

On March 26 at 23:00 UTC, Filecoin’s CalibrationNet will upgrade to network version 25 (Teep 🦵) at epoch 2523454. This upgrade brings key improvements to network performance and reliability, including a streamlined termination fee model for storage providers, enhanced Ethereum compatibility via transient storage in the FEVM, and the activation of F3 for faster transaction finality. [Check out the full details](https://status.filecoin.io/incidents/kjsd0lfmdfrf?u=rvg73wvwgk9v). 

### Introducing FIL ProPGF: A New Chapter in Public Goods Funding

The Filecoin ecosystem is entering a new era of community-led innovation with the launch of ProPGF, a prototype on-chain funding program designed to support critical public goods. Building on the momentum of RetroPGF, ProPGF introduces a proactive approach to funding new and existing projects through community governance, on-chain transparency, and incentivized participation. Applications open the week of March 31, with funding decisions set for early May. If you're building tools, advancing research, or improving UX within the ecosystem, this is your moment. Learn more and apply today at [fil-propgf.questbook.app](https://fil-propgf.questbook.app/).

### State of Filecoin Q4 2024: Key Highlights

Last week Messari published the “[State of Filecoin Q4 2024 Report](https://messari.io/report/state-of-filecoin-q4-2024?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=organic_social&utm_campaign=q4_quarterlies&utm_content=state_of_filecoin_q4_2024&destination=protocol_services_research)” reviewing Filecoin network growth, statistics, highlights and more from the last quarter of 2024. The network closed out 2024 with strong momentum in high-value storage and ecosystem growth. Daily storage deals rose 10% QoQ to 3.1 PiB, even as total capacity declined, signaling a continued shift toward enterprise adoption. Storage utilization ticked up to 32%, reflecting more efficient use of the network. On the smart contract front, the Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM) saw over 4,700 unique contracts and more than 3 million transactions. Filecoin also expanded its Layer-2 ecosystem with projects like Basin, Akave, and Storacha, driving advances in scalability, AI integration, and decentralized data coordination.

## 🌎 Community Updates 🌎

### Introducing Storacha AI

The future of AI lies in autonomy, collaboration, and verifiability—and centralized systems just can’t keep up. Enter [Storacha AI](https://storacha.ai/): the first AI-native decentralized storage layer, built on Filecoin, designed to power autonomous AI agents with permissionless data access, cryptographic integrity, and full data self-sovereignty. By leveraging Filecoin’s verifiable, tamper-proof storage network, Storacha enables agents to store, share, and verify data independently—unlocking complex multi-agent workflows like autonomous research teams and cross-org AI collaboration. The alpha is live now, and AI builders are invited to explore what’s possible. Read the [full blog to learn more](https://medium.com/@storacha/introducing-storacha-ai-fueling-the-future-of-autonomous-ai-1344ef159e9a) and [join the Storacha AI alpha](https://storacha.ai/).

### Building Together: The Power of Collaboration in the Filecoin Ecosystem

As the Filecoin ecosystem matures, a critical element of this next phase isn’t just about the technology—it’s about ecosystem coordination. Over the past year, we’ve seen a shift toward teams joining forces to build stronger, better solutions for clients. A key example is the [collaboration between CIDgravity and Lighthouse](https://fil.org/blog/building-together-the-power-of-collaboration-in-the-filecoin-ecosystem), which combines their strengths to make Filecoin more seamless and accessible. Their integration improves performance and usability, debunking misconceptions about the network’s capabilities, and sets a standard for ecosystem-wide cooperation. This kind of collaboration is key to delivering on Filecoin’s mission: reliable, decentralized storage at scale. [Read more about the collaboration](https://fil.org/blog/building-together-the-power-of-collaboration-in-the-filecoin-ecosystem). 

### Ungate Integrates Filecoin for Verifiable, Scalable AI

Ungate’s Wukong platform is redefining how autonomous AI agents operate—ensuring transparency, accountability, and trust through cryptographic proofs. Now, with its integration of Filecoin, Wukong gains tamper-proof, decentralized storage for agent execution logs and cryptographic proofs, boosting long-term security, scalability, and reliability. Proofs are initially stored on EigenDA for quick retrieval and then archived on Filecoin via Lighthouse, enabling seamless verification and compliance over time. This collaboration strengthens both ecosystems and advances the mission of building trustless, scalable AI infrastructure.

## 🎉 Events 🎉

### Update on FIL Dev Summit Toronto: Introducing Virtual Kickoff Sessions, happening on April 23-30​

Why the Virtual Sessions?

- ​More collaboration, less listening – By hosting most presentations virtually, we free up more in-person time for deep-dive discussions, live problem-solving, and decision making.
- ​Get up to speed ahead of time – Tracks will cover important updates and ecosystem progress so we can all hit the ground running in Toronto.
- ​More voices, more participation – A virtual format allows for broader access and input from contributors who cannot attend in-person.​

Sessions will cover:

​April 23 - The Filecoin State of the Union: Navigating Growth & Market Shifts

​April 24 - Storage Adoption: Winning Clients, Scaling Demand, and Lessons from the Field
