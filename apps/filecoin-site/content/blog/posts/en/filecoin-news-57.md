### Journey to FVM Launch on Filecoin Mainnet: Announcing Space Warp

The [Space Warp](https://spacewarp.fvm.dev/) program was launched to inspire developers to build with the new FEVM and unlock its vast potential in shaping the future of the data economy. Across grants, hackathon and more support programs for builders, the initiative aims to accelerate the development of new value-adding apps on the Filecoin network in preparation for FEVM mainnet launch in 2023. Check out [spacewarp.fvm.dev](http://spacewarp.fvm.dev) for an overview of opportunities and [submit an application](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/blob/master/Program%20Resources/Microgrants%20README.md) for a chance to be awarded a FVM Microgrant (20 x $5k available) to build on or with FEVM. Applications will be awarded on a rolling basis and close January 19, 2023.

### Hacking the Filecoin Ethereum Virtual Machine (FEVM)

The [first-ever Hack FEVM](https://ethglobal.medium.com/hack-fevm-2022-4d31781408b5) welcomed over 400 hackers to build and showcase 117 projects with over $50,000 awarded through various prizes! Throughout the hackathon, 11 talks introduced the Filecoin Virtual Machine and a variety of resources for developers. These included tutorials with familiar EVM developer tools, introduction to FEVM-specific tools, and a brainstorm on FEVM use cases. Get up to speed on the [Filecoin blog](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/hacking-the-filecoin-ethereum-virtual-machine-fevm/) or watch this [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWbZffRhp6Q&list=PLXzKMXK2aHh5SiBAeA6FGnhc6Sw4gRDlI) for full-length recordings of the presentations.

### Get to Know the FEVM Hackathon Finalists

The FEVM hackathon introduced FEVM to the wider Ethereum ecosystem, with close mentorship and resources that supported hackers and their projects. Ethereum developers got to deploy EVM out-of-the-box to FVM, giving their smart contracts the ability to interact directly with placeholder storage deals on the test network during the hackathon to simulate the workflow, and eventually with deals on the Filecoin storage network. We’re excited to announce the ETHGlobal, Filecoin, and Pool Prize finalists! Find out more about them on the [Filecoin blog](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/announcing-the-hack-fevm-finalists/).

### Business Models on the FVM

Filecoin is building an economy of open data services. A great sample use case of what FVM can do is a perpetual storage protocol using a combination of Web3 DeFi primitives and Filecoin’s storage services. The basic goal of perpetual storage is straightforward: enable users to specify terms for how their datasets should be stored without having to run additional infrastructure to manage repair or renewal of deals. Find out how this is possible in this [TL;DR blog post](https://medium.com/tldrfilecoin/business-models-on-the-fvm-23cd71fdd3f1) by Ecosystem Lead, Jonathan Victor.

### Seal Storage and the ATLAS Experiment at CERN

Web3 cloud storage is making an impact in the real world. Projects like Seal Storage are Filecoin Storage Providers who are working with academia and businesses to get around the chokehold of #Web2 hosting services. Hear from Alex Altman, COO of Seal Storage, about their latest partnership with the ATLAS experiment at CERN and why organizations are adopting decentralized storage. A full video recording of his talk at FIL Lisbon is available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRj94fJednY&list=PLp3zrT1ewY0kWhcrnEWz1r3r2k97TjPz2&index=9).
