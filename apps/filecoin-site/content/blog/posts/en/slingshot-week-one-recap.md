It’s been an exciting week with the kickoff of Filecoin Slingshot, a two-part competition for storage clients and developers to deploy their products to the testnet. Phase One of this competition (“Onboard”), which started on September 23, 2020 and runs through October 14, aims to onboard 1PiB of real, useful data to the Filecoin network. Phase Two (“Scale”) aims to onboard 10PiB of data. Between the two phases, participants have a chance at getting a share of a prize pool of up to 500,000 FIL based on their network storage commitments!

Slingshot is part of Filecoin’s [Ignite series](https://hub.fil.org/events/) of events, and is a collaborative event intended to stress-test the network and encourage participation from storage users all over the world. Space Race 2: Slingshot is designed specifically for storage clients, app developers, tooling providers, and other community members. Teams can participate in the competition in one of two ways:

1. Build an end-user facing application that stores application and user data to Filecoin.
2. Store data from a [curated list of data collections](https://github.com/filecoin-project/slingshot/blob/master/datasets.md) and create an accompanying UI to utilize and access this data.

To date, we’ve had more than 100 teams sign up for the competition, making more than 26,000 storage deals so far. Slingshot is accepting applications through the end of the competition! You can register to participate [on the Slingshot website](https://slingshot.filecoin.io/).

Here’s where the competition stands as of 20:00 UTC Friday, September 25, two days into the competition:

**Week One in Review**

On September 23rd, we launched the competition with our [kickoff event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTn2QCLh1PY). During this event, the Slingshot team introduced the rules, announced upcoming events and shared guidance for participants entering the competition. In addition, Andrew Hill, co-founder and CEO of [Textile](https://textile.io/), advised teams on how to accelerate their products with Textile’s tools, and Juan Benet, founder and CEO of Protocol Labs, offered ideas for different datasets and applications.

On September 25, we held our first Slingshot Master Class, [Filecoin 101](https://youtu.be/qKUHKFzYws8), where @ribasushi, a developer at Protocol Labs, covered the basics of Filecoin in a hands-on tutorial. Topics included the concepts underpinning Filecoin, using the CLI, and making deals with miners.

**What’s Ahead**

We have more amazing events coming up, including more master classes, open office hours, workshops, and a series called “How We Built This” that showcases development teams and how they built their projects and/or companies.

Here’s our event lineup for the upcoming week!
