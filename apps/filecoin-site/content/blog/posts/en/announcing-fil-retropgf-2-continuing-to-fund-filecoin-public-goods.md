Inspired by Optimism, FIL-RetroPGF is a pioneering retroactive impact funding initiative tailored to the unique needs of the Filecoin community. [Round 1](https://fil-retropgf.io/) has already made waves, successfully distributing over 200,000 FIL to 95 diverse projects. As we prepare for FIL-RetroPGF-2, set to launch in Fall 2024, our excitement grows as we work to refine and enhance the program, recognizing the remarkable contributions of hundreds of builders in the coming months.

### 💪 Celebrating Our Funders

FIL-RetroPGF would not be possible without the generous support of our funders. In the inaugural round, contributors such as Titan Network, [web3mine/Ramo](https://www.ramo.io), [Filecoin Foundation](https://fil.org/), and [Protocol Labs](https://protocol.ai/) played a pivotal role, collectively enabling the distribution of nearly $1 million USD to 95 public goods projects within the Filecoin ecosystem.

As we look ahead to FIL-RetroPGF-2, we invite more donors to join this impactful initiative. By becoming a funder, you have the opportunity to make a lasting contribution, influence the direction of the Filecoin ecosystem, and amplify the incentives driving the growth of Filecoin public goods. To explore how you can get involved and learn about our sponsorship packages, please reach out to us at [ops@fil-retropgf.io](mailto:ops@fil-retropgf.io).

### 🔄 Round 2: Stronger, Faster, Better

We are thrilled to announce that Round 2, launching in Fall 2024, will be an even more robust, efficient, and user-friendly experience.

- Stronger: Increased funding will be allocated to eligible projects, ensuring broader support across the ecosystem.
- Faster: The application process, badgeholder voting, and distribution timeline will be streamlined for greater efficiency.
- Better: User experience improvements, informed by feedback from badgeholders, applicants, and funders, will enhance communication through our dedicated Telegram channel, and funding will be seamlessly streamed via [Drips on FVM](https://drips.network/). For a detailed overview of the upcoming changes, we invite you to review the insights from Round 1.

### 🏅 Spotlight on High-Impact Projects

The second round will continue to support a broad array of categories, as seen in Round 1:

- **Infrastructure & Dependencies:** Essential software for building or deploying the FIL Stack, contributions to protocols or standards, and experimental projects that support the future development of the core FIL Stack protocol.
- **Tooling & Utilities:** Resources that empower builders to create applications on the Filecoin mainnet, enhance the FIL Stack, or utilize applications built on Filecoin.
- **Education & Outreach:** Initiatives aimed at spreading awareness and understanding of Filecoin, welcoming both technical and social contributions.
- **Protocol Research & Development:** Efforts to advance the Filecoin protocol, encompassing both theoretical contributions and practical implementations.
- **Collective Governance:** Projects that influence Filecoin's governance or introduce new participants to the network’s governance processes.
- **Products & End-User UX:** Innovations that improve the user experience and foster the adoption of Filecoin technology.
- **Other:** Significant contributions that don't neatly fit into the above categories.

In Round 2, we are particularly eager to see submissions that demonstrate:

- Successful onboarding of clients through Filecoin data on-ramps.
- Applications that enhance Filecoin’s usability.
- Innovations in FVM on-chain payments.
- Breakthroughs in fundamental protocol R\&D within the Filecoin ecosystem.
- Projects that forge new connections to Filecoin from external networks.
- Reliable tools like high-quality RPC providers, explorers, and dashboards.

These high-impact examples are intended to inspire your creativity, but they are by no means exhaustive. We encourage you to think expansively and explore other innovative ideas.
