## Filecoin’s Growth Ahead of the FVM Launch

Over 20,000 individual users are now storing more than 50 million data objects on Filecoin, all supported by a 20% month-over-month increase in Storage Providers. This significant growth comes right before the network adds new compute over data capabilities. The Filecoin Virtual Machine will allow 7,000 new developers to build decentralized applications directly on Filecoin that can leverage all the data stored on the network.

## FIP0036: Everything You Need to Know

Filecoin Improvement Proposals (FIPs) are ways for the Filecoin community to come together to propose, debate, vote, and implement upgrades to the Filecoin network. The Filecoin community has been discussing [FIP0036](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0036.md) proposed by [CryptoEconLab](https://research.protocol.ai/groups/cryptoeconlab/). FIP0036 seeks to align network incentives to promote the “health, stability, and prosperity of the Filecoin network's economy and its participants.” FIP0036 opened for voting on September 14. The voting period ends on September 28 at 22:00 UTC.

## What the FVM Unlocks

The FVM can be used for the creation of a new class of web3 dApps, many of which will have the potential to become 10x improvements to the network’s functionality and beyond. Members of the Filecoin community are already excited about what can be built with these new capabilities. Find out how you can participate and start building some of these new use cases on the [Filecoin blog](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/what-the-fvm-unlocks/).
