### Announcing Filecoin - Polygon Bridge with Free Storage for Developers

Filecoin is announcing a collaboration with [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) to accelerate Web3 interoperability between both ecosystems. The collaboration kicks off with the recently-created Filecoin-Polygon Bridge by the [Textile](https://www.textile.io/) team. To further encourage developers to try out and build on the bridge, Filecoin and Polygon are offering free storage costs for any projects using the Textile bridge. Both projects have also lined up two upcoming joint hackathons where developers can try the bridge and begin building new applications.

To get started on the bridge deployment on Polygon, simply visit the instructions and documentation at [eth.storage](https://eth.storage/javascript/#eth--polygon). (All storage costs using the bridge are free!) To learn more about the collaboration, check out [this post](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/announcing-filecoin-polygon-bridge-and-free-storage-for-developers/).

### Mask Network × Filecoin: Bridging the Gap Between Web2 and Web3

Last week, [Mask Network](https://mask.io/) and Filecoin announced a collaboration to bridge the gap between Web2 and Web3 by bringing decentralized storage solutions to Mask users.

Mask Network is a leading protocol connecting Web2 platforms with Web3 principles. The Mask browser extension allows anyone to interact with others on traditional platforms like Facebook and Twitter, but do so through and with Web3 principles and solutions. Users can send and receive encrypted messages, transfer cryptocurrencies, and fund projects on Gitcoin. And soon, store and share files through Filecoin. [Download the Mask browser extension](https://mask.io/) and get started.

With the Mask browser extension, users will be able to choose to upload particular files to the Filecoin network, and share them as either encrypted or unencrypted assets to their networks. [Read more](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/mask-network-x-filecoin-bridging-the-gap-between-web2-and-web3/) about this accelerated path towards the vision of storing and securing humanity’s digital information.

### Web3.Storage Feature in The New Stack

A shoutout from The New Stack about [Web3.Storage](http://web3.storage/) — recently launched to provide developers with free access (yes, indefinitely) to Filecoin’s storage solutions. Web3.storage provides redundancy and easy use, opening up the world of decentralized storage to even greater numbers of veteran and new Web3 developers alike. [Check out the New Stack overview](https://thenewstack.io/web3-storage-free-decentralized-storage-on-filecoin/).

### Filecoin Community Approves Change to Storage Provider Terminology

On August 20th, the [Filecoin community approved Filecoin Improvement Proposal 18 (FIP-0018)](https://filecoinfoundation.medium.com/filecoin-community-approves-change-to-storage-provider-terminology-2320839b153b), which reframes messaging around the storage market and those who participate in it as storage providers. The decision was made after several weeks of soliciting input and feedback on FIP-0018 from across the Filecoin community. This change will be implemented across Filecoin docs sites, Githhub, both Filecoin and Filecoin Foundation official social media channels, as well as other ecosystem tools. To learn more about the motivation behind this decision, read [this post](https://filecoinfoundation.medium.com/filecoin-community-approves-change-to-storage-provider-terminology-2320839b153b).

<a href="https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/releases/tag/v1.11.1"><img src="/uploads/lotus.webp" style="width:25%;margin-left:0%"></a>

### Lotus Release v1.11.1

[Lotus v1.11.1](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/releases/tag/v1.11.1) has been released! This is a highly recommended Lotus feature release that introduces many deal making and datastore improvements plus new features and bug fixes. Check out the full [release notes](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/releases/tag/v1.11.1) featuring the concepts, architecture, and more.

<a href="https://github.com/filecoin-project/rust-fil-proofs/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#901---2021-08-16"><img src="/uploads/checks.webp" style="width:40%;margin-left:0%"></a>

### Proofs v9.0.0 & v9.0.1 Release

[Proofs releases v9.0.0 and v9.0.1](https://github.com/filecoin-project/rust-fil-proofs/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#901---2021-08-16) are live and tagged in the lotus v1.11.2rc series for testing! These releases switch the default bls381 library from pairing to blst, as it’s been audited and measured for better performance. Given that storage providers were largely using blst as an optional feature for some time, it made sense to make it the default. This release also switches our internal threadpool implementation from rayon to yastl for improved scheduling in our parallel workloads.
