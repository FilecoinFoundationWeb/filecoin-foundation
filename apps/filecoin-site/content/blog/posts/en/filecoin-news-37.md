### **Vivid Labs: Using Filecoin to Preserve Advanced Multimedia NFTs**

Vivid Labs doesn’t see NFTs as just digital collectibles but as next-generation media objects that create better content experiences. The project, which started as the VideoCoin Network, pivoted to NFTs 18 months ago as it realized their potential for more complex media types like video. Now, Vivid Labs enables creators to develop rich multimedia experiences through features like [NFT+](https://medium.com/vivid-labs/introducing-nft-71767a8d3644) on the VIVID platform. It encrypts all media via an on-chain ClearKey DRM and uses Filecoin’s decentralized storage to ensure the security and preservation of the NFT. Learn more about Vivid Labs on the Filecoin [blog](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/vivid-labs-using-filecoin-to-preserve-advanced-multimedia-nfts/).

### **Announcing DGM, a New Decentralized Grants Marketplace**

Protocol Labs has launched a new platform for large-scale grants where funders within decentralized ecosystems can support important work. The Decentralized Grants Marketplace (DGM) aims to help projects reach ambitious roadmaps through a broader community of contributors. It will launch with a set of inaugural grants for the Filecoin ecosystem. Learn more about the DGM and how to participate in any of the initial grants on the Filecoin [blog](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/announcing-dgm-a-new-decentralized-grants-marketplace/). You can also apply to be a [funder](https://airtable.com/shrrFHFi1PucZij51) or a [member](https://airtable.com/shrjDwJ09O4NNIHnY) of the team.

### **Public Goods Funding Opportunity: Network Documentation**

As part of efforts to fund public goods in the network, Protocol Labs is launching a new challenge to reward high quality documentation (developer docs, blogposts, tutorials, etc.) for teams building directly on the IPFS or Filecoin stack. This challenge will run for 3 months, with over $80k in potential rewards for teams that improve their docs and gather strong user feedback. View the [full details](https://github.com/protocol/Network-Funding/blob/main/Documentation_challenge.md) and [apply](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdmJki5UoaRMlrWDfxeVZYSw3CpfDT2pkGM8fS6cWl404bCnw/viewform?usp=sf_link) to participate.

### **Gala Games: Decentralized Gaming Supported by Filecoin and IPFS**

Today’s games are rich multimedia and art experiences, but that depth comes at a cost. As immersive games cross over the Web3 frontier, developers in the space will need tools at their disposal to organize, analyze, archive, and deploy massive amounts of data. [Gala Games](https://app.gala.games/about/) is a solution that meets these needs and helps different teams and projects develop games on chain. Learn more about Gala Games and how they’re using Filecoin and IPFS for their large amounts of backup data in this [recent blog post](https://blog.ipfs.tech/2022-02-27-gala-games-decentralized-gaming/).

### **SnapDeals Circuits Verification is Complete**

The Filecoin community [generated](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/trusted-setup-complete-for-network-v15-upgrade/) secure parameters for four new circuits to be used on mainnet in January. This was the first step to enable [SnapDeals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIYfKlt2NhE&t=1s) on the network. Last week, the verification process for these circuits was completed. Their outputs can be trusted if the transcript is entirely verifiable, and you would need to trust that at least one of the participants did not leak their contributed randomness in any way. To verify that the parameters for our SnapDeals circuits are the same as the output from our participants you can follow the instructions on [GitHub](https://github.com/filecoin-project/phase2-attestations/tree/9cb8bece7611b09ec016c2d3a607e4317e45af54/934fe8c#phase-2-validation).

### **Network Indexer**

The Protocol Labs Engineering Team has started rolling out an indexing system for content routing on the Filecoin Network. This helps make Filecoin content more discoverable. In this system, Storage Providers will offer manifests of the available content they have for retrieval, and clients can query network Indexer nodes for a service much like the IPFS DHT. The team has indexed data from a few initial Storage Providers and aims to merge the Storage Provider enhancement for general availability on Lotus-based Storage Providers in the coming weeks. Visit [cid.contact](https://cid.contact/) to learn more and reach out to the team at [#storetheindex](https://filecoinproject.slack.com/archives/C02T827T9N0) in [Filecoin Slack](http://filecoin.io/slack) to get involved.

### **UI Demo for the Filecoin-Substrate Bridge with ChainSafe**

Our collaborators at ChainSafe have presented a [UI demo](https://youtu.be/_zBZRN-OMtA) of a new project they’ve been working on called the Filecoin-Substrate Bridge (FSB). This extends the functionality of the Filecoin Network and allows developers to build features on a Substrate chain that rely on the state of Filecoin. The UI lets users verify that a new block CID is valid as well as mint NFTs on Substrate under the new [RMRK standard](https://www.rmrk.app/). [Read along](https://medium.com/chainsafe-systems/ui-demo-rmrk-nfts-with-the-filecoin-substrate-bridge-e063c02a0d64) to find out more about the project and what it can do.

### **drand Update**

drand, the distributed randomness beacon used by Filecoin, is getting an update with two important new features that enable multi-frequency support and timelock encryption!

In summary, the new features include:

- Unchained Randomness: Each randomness beacon in drand has so far been linked to the previous one, forming a chain of beacons. With this update, each beacon is now independent of (all) the previous one(s), which in turn enables messages to be encrypted in the future (i.e., using a future beacon).
- Multi-protocol Support: Drand is now able to support multiple protocols running on the same physical node and the same binary. In other words, a node can now participate in multiple drand networks, each of which having different characteristics. These characteristics can be different frequency of emitting randomness, different thresholds, different participants or having randomness in chained or unchained mode.

Read [the blogpost](https://drand.love/blog/2022/02/21/multi-frequency-support-and-timelock-encryption-capabilities/) and the comprehensive [FAQ doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16QJG3Z-Kr0mN6snQz8cm0NnMXpYBpelKyvCf2oo1Zgc/edit?usp=sharing) to find out all the details.

### **Filecoin Sealing Survey**

The sealing process is one of the most important yet demanding aspects of becoming a Storage Provider on the Filecoin Network. We are conducting a survey to determine the current need for sealing power. This sealing offering will provide Storage Providers with access to resources tol accelerate sealing Committed Capacity sectors. Take one minute to fill [this survey](https://5ufz7ber0fd.typeform.com/sealingservice?utm_campaign=sealing-as-a-service) and help us determine how useful this service could be to the Filecoin community.
