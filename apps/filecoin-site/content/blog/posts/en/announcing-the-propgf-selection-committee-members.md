We are excited to introduce the inaugural Selection Committee for the [Filecoin ProPGF](https://fil-propgf.questbook.app/) program. This expert group will guide public goods funding decisions within the Filecoin ecosystem throughout the 2025 prototype phase, ensuring transparency, diversity, and community alignment at every step.

The committee is composed of individuals with deep expertise in the cryptocurrency landscape, public goods, decentralized storage, go-to-market strategy, community engagement, and open-source project management. Members were carefully selected for their professional experience, balanced representation, and commitment to the Filecoin ecosystem’s values and goals.

Below are the ten members of the ProPGF Selection Committee. Each brings a unique perspective and skillset to the program:

- Jennifer Wang, \[COO /FilOz]
- Jonathan Victor, \[Co-Founder / Ansa Research]
- Sarah Thiam, \[Founder, CEO / FIL-B]
- Eva Shon, \[Founder / Fil-Ponto]
- Mark Ery, \[Grant Operations Lead / Starknet]
- Sejal Rekhan, \[Grants Innovation / Gitcoin, Allo]
- ZX Zhang, \[Lead / CryptoEconLab]
- Paul Wagner, \[Business Development Lead / Filecoin Foundation]
- Stefan Magdalinski, \[Head of Technical Programs / Filecoin Foundation]
- Josh Daniels, \[Lead / Protocol Labs Filecoin Impact Fund (PLFIF)]
- Irma Jiang, \[Head of Orbit Greater China / Co-founder of ND Labs & MSquare]

## Committee Strategy and Commitment

The Selection Committee operates with a clear and principled strategy rooted in expertise, diversity, and transparency. Members are selected for their deep knowledge of Filecoin, decentralized technology, and public goods funding, ensuring decisions are informed and aligned with ecosystem goals. The committee is intentionally diverse and representative, encompassing a range of perspectives, backgrounds, and geographies from across the Filecoin and broader crypto landscape. To preserve integrity and trust, strict conflict-of-interest policies are in place, supporting independent and objective decision-making. Members are actively involved, dedicating 2–3 hours per week during active cycles and 1 hour during off-cycle periods, with incentives provided in FIL tokens. All operations are conducted transparently—decisions and voting take place on-chain, with clear, accessible guidelines for governance and communication.

## Looking Ahead

The ProPGF Selection Committee is fundamental to a transparent, community-driven funding model for public goods in the Filecoin ecosystem. We look forward to their leadership in shaping the future of open, decentralized innovation during 2025. Stay tuned for more details on the committee’s work.
