  Today we’re excited to announce ProtoSchool’s first-ever Filecoin tutorial,
  Verifying Storage on Filecoin. It offers a beginner-friendly, code-free look
  at Filecoin’s proof system, exploring how Proof of Replication (PoRep), Proof
  of Storage (PoSt), and zkSNARKs make it possible to trust peers in an
  incentivized, decentralized storage system.

One of Filecoin’s most distinguishing features is its approach to verifiable storage. In a recent [blog post](https://filecoin.io/blog/filecoin-features-verifiable-storage/), we summarized how Filecoin implements decentralized storage with a combination of consensus mechanisms and cryptographic proofs that allow clients to trust that miners are storing their data as agreed.

Today we’re excited to announce ProtoSchool’s first-ever Filecoin tutorial, [**Verifying Storage on Filecoin**](https://proto.school/#/verifying-storage-on-filecoin). It offers a beginner-friendly, code-free look at Filecoin’s proof system, exploring how Proof of Replication (PoRep), Proof of Storage (PoSt), and zkSNARKs make it possible to trust peers in an incentivized, decentralized storage system.

If you haven’t yet done so, we encourage you to check out our [Decentralized Data Structures](https://proto.school/#/data-structures) tutorial before digging into Verifying Storage on Filecoin. It explores concepts that are key to building trust on the decentralized web, including cryptographic hashing, content addressing, Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG), and Merkle Trees.

For other content relevant to Filecoin, you can check out our [Anatomy of a CID](https://proto.school/#/anatomy-of-a-cid) tutorial, which explores the structure of CIDs (Content Identifiers) as defined by the Multiformats project. These unique labels are used to point to data stored on distributed information systems including IPFS, IPLD, libp2p, and Filecoin.
