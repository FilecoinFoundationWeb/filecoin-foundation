## Announcements

[![](/uploads/fil-blog-2021-11-02-fvm.webp)](https://spec.filecoin.io/intro/filecoin_vm/)

### Announcing the Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM)

The goal of the Filecoin Virtual Machine is to enable users to deploy their own smart contracts on the Filecoin blockchain,” FVM brings general programmability and compatibility with Ethereum Virtual Machine smart contracts to the Filecoin blockchain. Attendees of Filecoin Orbit were among the first in the world to learn about FVM, its vision, the thousands of opportunities that it will unlock, its implementation roadmap, and how to [join the action](https://spec.filecoin.io/intro/filecoin_vm/).

### Filecoin Green

How can Filecoin storage providers lead the way in building a verifiably environmentally sustainable blockchain? Key stakeholders within the Filecoin ecosystem including Juan Benet, [Filecoin Green](https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/protocol-labs-and-energy-web-complete-first-showcase-of-an-open-source-solution-to-decarbonize-1a8c22ac02f5) project lead [Alan Ransil, PhD](https://twitter.com/rransil), [](https://www.ou.nl/)[Radboud University](https://www.ru.nl/english/) Associate Professor of Computer Science [Harald Vranken](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=J3ZE7nEAAAAJ&hl=en), and many others explored this question, and [revealed a path for environmental sustainability in Filecoin](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_0VrY55uV18i8gXWcuVLK3J60cetDP6E).

Juan stated, “Don’t settle for zero — Filecoin can and should aim to be 10x green with net carbon emissions of -1,000.”

We are planning events, grants and other support to enable Filecoin to become verifiably environmentally beneficial and to track environmental impacts throughout the web. Join #fil-green on Filecoin Slack to be the first to find out about new opportunities or tell us what you think needs to be built in this space on [GitHub](https://github.com/protocol/FilecoinGreen-tools).

### CryptoComputeLab announces proofs release version 10.0.0.0

[CryptoComputeLab](https://github.com/protocol/cryptocomputelab) is very proud to release [Proofs v10.0.0](https://github.com/filecoin-project/rust-fil-proofs/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1000---2021-09-30)! A lot has changed under the hood in this release, but ultimately, it comes down to additional GPU support options and better performance during proving. The far less visible highlights include consolidating a number of our internal dependencies which started life as forks from other projects back to the upstream sources. This kind of tooling update is beneficial for several reasons, including gaining optimizations from the upstream sources as our code diverged over time, and also making future updates (e.g. Halo2 work) more realistic. [Read all about the release](https://research.protocol.ai/blog/2021/cryptocomputelab-announces-proofs-release-version-10.0.0.0/).

### Filecoin becomes official storage layer for Flow Blockchain

Filecoin is now the official storage layer of Flow blockchain, empowering platforms, developers and users alike as the Flow metaverse becomes more open, robust, and decentralized. This integration of technologies will accelerate end-to-end ownership of NFTs, along with the media assets associated with them, establishing decentralized storage of data on Flow.

## Tools

### IPLD in WASM

Underneath IPFS is a system known as IPLD that deals with all the heavy lifting that IPFS does to store data on-chain and create hash-links which we see as content IDs (CIDs). At its most basic form, Interplanetary Linked Data (IPLD) is the data layer that IPFS is built on top of. It creates a series of links to data but also allows users to create those links themselves through simple data structures that can be stored on IPFS.

During Filecoin Orbit, Steven Allen gave a walkthrough of IPLD and WASM, and how they work together to power the newly-announced Filecoin Virtual Machine. [Watch here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMlSGtHb-hU).

### Storage Providers

### Filecoin Auctions with Textile

Textile's Filecoin Deal Auctions will award 250FIL in prizes to Storage Providers with the highest reputation over two weeks, starting next week. Storage providers can take part in deal auctions by running a lightweight client called [bidbot](https://github.com/textileio/bidbot). To date, over 200TiB have been won and stored by storage providers using the system.
