## Announcements

### Filecoin Network Version 21 Watermelon Upgrade

The Filecoin Mainnet will be performing a Network Upgrade to v21, codenamed Watermelon, at epoch 3469380 around 2023-12-12T13:30:00Z. This upgrade delivers ‘juicy’ features and enhancements for SP's operations and FVM, and protocol bug fixes.

Given this upgrade introduces many state changes for the network, state migration may take slightly longer than former upgrades. Therefore, node operators may expect slower block validation times, increased CPU and memory usage, and longer delays for API queries during pre-migration/migration base on the implementation that node operator is using, the size of the states stored in block store, and the hardware spec that's running. Please see the [implementation release notes](https://github.com/filecoin-project/community/discussions/74?sort=new#discussioncomment-7274188) for more details.

That being said, core devs are NOT expecting any network disruptions. Nevertheless, we'd like to proactively schedule a longer than usual maintenance window, and kindly ask the Filecoin community to join us as we monitor the network post-upgrade and let the implementers know if you have any questions. Please see the [community announcement](https://github.com/filecoin-project/community/discussions/74?sort=new#discussioncomment-7274188) for more information.
