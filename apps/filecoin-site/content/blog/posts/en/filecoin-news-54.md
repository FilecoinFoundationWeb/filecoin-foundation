### Filecoin’s Q3 According to Messari

The Messari community has put together a comprehensive look at what Q3 2022 looked like for the Filecoin network. It’s findings are exciting, to say the least. During the third quarter of the year, active storage Filecoin has grown 82% QoQ and storage utilization grew 6x faster than storage capacity during the past year, all on the back of FIL+ deals. The network also saw a 12% increase in new projects using its technology. [**Read the report**](https://messari.io/report/state-of-filecoin-q3-2022) to find out more.

### How to Get Started in Web3 with Protocol Labs

Protocol Labs’ mission is to drive breakthroughs in computing technology and push humanity forward. This involves collaborating with as many brilliant humans as possible. However, it can still be difficult for many to get started in the Web3 ecosystem. Those looking to start a new project need to be matched with funding, and those interested in bringing their talents into the space may struggle with the knowledge gap between Web2 and Web3. [**Learn about the opportunities**](https://protocol.ai/blog/get-involved-in-web3/) available for everyone in the Protocol Labs Network.

### Multichain Storage x Chainlink Price Feeds

[**FilSwan**](https://filswan.com/homepage/) announced that [**multichain.storage**](https://multichain.storage/) (MCS), a cross-chain Filecoin storage gateway, has integrated [**Chainlink Price Feeds**](https://data.chain.link/) on the Polygon mainnet. MCS enables users to pay for Filecoin storage with stablecoins and backup their data on up to 5 Filecoin nodes. The addition of Chainlink Price Feeds will provide more accurate and time-sensitive market data on FIL/USD and USDC/USD pairs when swapping tokens for cross-chain storage. Find out more on the [**FilSwan blog**](https://filswan.medium.com/filswan-integrates-chainlink-price-feeds-to-help-secure-multi-chain-storage-payments-f0bdaac84233). FilSwan currently provides 10GB of free storage space for each user, so give the new integration a try!
