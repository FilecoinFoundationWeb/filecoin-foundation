## Announcements

### 10M FIL deposited in just 6 months since FVM mainnet launch! 

The amount of FIL pledged via apps built on the [Filecoin Virtual Machine](http://fvm.dev/) just passed 10M in the last week! This milestone was surpassed 6 months after the launch of FVM. Check out these amazing stats: 

- \~2,600 distinct token holders have deposited ~4M in Glif, ~2M in stFIL, ~2M in HashKing, and ~2M across 6 other protocols
- 353 Storage Provider Systems have engaged in leasing or borrowing FIL from one of the nine staking apps
- The [TVL of Filecoin via FVM](https://defillama.com/chain/Filecoin), according to DeFi Llama, has surpassed $80M USD

Filecoin leasing and staking apps connect token holders with storage providers (SPs), so that SPs can access FIL for pledge collateral. SPs then use this pledge collateral to onboard humanity's most important information. The launch of these smart contract-based solutions built on FVM has enabled individuals to participate in the Filecoin ecosystem in unprecedented ways.

As leasing and staking of Filecoin continues to grow, it will help make onboarding data faster and more efficient by providing SPs with more access to FIL for pledge collateral. For more information, check out the [Starboard DeFi Leaderboard](https://fvm.starboard.ventures/explorer/leaderboard) to quantitatively evaluate protocols and [Filecoin TLDR](https://filecointldr.io/how-to-stake-filecoin) for information on how to evaluate FIL leasing and staking options.
