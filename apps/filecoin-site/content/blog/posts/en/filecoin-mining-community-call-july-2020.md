We are excited to announce the next Filecoin Mining Community Call. It will begin with a Filecoin ecosystem update and an overview of the progress that has been made since the last mining call. You’ll then learn everything you need to know to get ready for the Space Race, our Testnet Incentives Program. Finally we’ll conclude with a Q&A about mining on the Filecoin network.

**Call details: Tuesday, July 21, 2020 at 6:00pm PST | Wednesday, July 22 at 9:00am CST**

Here’s how to participate:

1. [Set up an account](https://filecoin.io/slack) on the Filecoin Project Slack.
2. We will post a link to the call on the **#fil-mining** slack channel 5 mins before the call.
3. Please submit any questions you have to this [form](https://filecoin-community.typeform.com/to/ECeCr32I). We’ll get through as many as we can in the alloted time.
4. Please review the [Filecoin Community Code of Conduct](https://github.com/filecoin-project/community/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before the session. In general, treat each other with respect.

If you cannot attend this Filecoin Mining Community Call, don’t worry! We will record the session and add it to our [Filecoin Community repo](https://github.com/filecoin-project/community) on GitHub. Please “watch” this repo to stay informed about this call and other future community calls and events. If you have any questions, please reach out to our team at [mining@filecoin.io](mailto:mining@filecoin.io) or on the **#fil-mining** channel on our [Community Chat](https://github.com/filecoin-project/community#chat).

Thank you again for your continued enthusiasm and support of Filecoin!
