## ‚ú® Highlights ‚ú®

### Empowering Decentralization: Solana's Integration with Filecoin

The Filecoin ecosystem has begun an effort to store Solana chain‚Äôs historical data onto the network. This strategic collaboration is being driven by the Triton One and DCENT teams. The effort ensures that Solana‚Äôs block history and ledger is stored on a leading decentralized storage network, in turn also making the data accessible to various stakeholders such as infrastructure providers, explorers, indexers and more. Crucially, this collaboration showcases the power of blockchain networks to create more robust and resilient ecosystems for the benefit of users and developers. We look forward to updating the community as this effort progresses.

### Five Filecoin Bounties with $24k in Prizes Available at ETHDenver‚Äôs #BUIDLWEEK

We're excited to announce a series of five groundbreaking Filecoin bounties at this year's ETHDenver #BUIDLWEEK! These challenges are designed to push the boundaries of decentralized storage and computation, offering developers early access to cutting-edge technologies and the opportunity to shape the future of the decentralized web. Here are the details of each bounty:

1. Scaling with Interplanetary Consensus - Most Meaningful Deployment:¬†Create a dApp on a custom purpose subnet utilizing InterPlanetary Consensus (IPC) and General Message Passing (GMP) for early developer access.
2. Compute with Interplanetary Consensus: Best Deployment to IPC-Powered Testnets for Computation Use Cases:¬†Use an IPC-powered subnet for executing computation tasks, focusing on practical computation applications.
3. Scaling with Interplanetary Consensus ‚Äì Best Use of Custom Syscalls or Built-in Actors to Extend the Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM):¬†Use IPC to deploy a custom subnet and develop functionality beyond what's possible with Solidity, utilizing custom syscalls and Rust built-in actors.
4. Build an App to Track & Reward the Activities of the Ambassadors of the Filecoin Orbit Program: Develop an app on Filecoin & FVM that tracks and rewards Filecoin Orbit Volunteer Ambassador activities with NFT ‚Äúachievements‚Äù and ERC20 token reward points.
5. Most Impactful DApp-Tooling Built with the Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM) on Filecoin:¬†Build solutions/tooling on the FVM for Filecoin's testnets to enhance the Filecoin storage marketplace and its ecosystem, using FVM data management features and 3rd party integrations.

Join us at ETHDenver #BUIDLWEEK to leverage these exciting opportunities. Whether you're a developer looking to explore new technologies or a visionary aiming to make a mark on the decentralized world, these bounties provide a platform to showcase your skills, innovate, and potentially transform the future of decentralized storage.
