The Filecoin community is thrilled to announce the [FIL Dev Summit](https://fildev.io/) - a gathering of developers, builders, and engaged community members who want to contribute to the core protocol and network evolution of Filecoin! We are kicking off this brand new summit with two regional hubs - one in Singapore (September 12-14th) and the other in Iceland (September 25-27th) to better reach the global Filecoin community.

The FIL Dev Summit isn't just about improving technology; it's about people and communities coming together to shape the future of decentralized storage. It's about protocol developers sharing insights with smart contract builders, and storage providers collaborating with governance-focused token holders. By gathering developers from diverse backgrounds, the summit sets the foundation for a more efficient, secure, and dynamic Filecoin ecosystem. This event will focus on driving ecosystem progress, with a robust emphasis on collaborative synergy, a well-defined strategic outlook, and boundless opportunity for innovation.

### An Immersive Experience at FIL Dev Summit: What to Expect

The summit is more than just a meetup—it's a place for meaningful and impactful conversations that help push Filecoin forward. Discussions at the summit will cover a wide range of topics, from protocol scalability and network improvements to the intricacies of data onboarding and governance structures. These conversations serve to share and refine improvements - where participants can gain insights from diverse perspectives, challenge assumptions, and collectively arrive at innovative solutions to the challenges faced by the Filecoin ecosystem.
