## Dive into the Filecoin Virtual Machine

Announced during Filecoin Orbit 2021, the Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM) marks the next evolution of the Filecoin Network, bringing together decentralized storage and powerful computation. The FVM allows smart contracts (called ‘actors’ in the Filecoin ecosystem) to endow the data stored on the network with more utility and power. Based on WASM, the FVM is built to be multi-VM, starting with EVM compatibility — ensuring Filecoin’s storage solutions can scale to the growing, interoperable needs of Web3. [Dive into the FVM](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/introducing-the-filecoin-virtual-machine/).

## Filecoin Forum by MoNa Gallery Bounty Winners

With over 450 registered builders, and 75 incredible Spaces submitted, the largest ever Metaverse Build Bounty is wrapping up. This event, sponsored by Filecoin, was designed to spur the creation and use of open metaverse spaces. After lengthy deliberation, the judging panel has decided their favorite Spaces they’d like to bid on. These Spaces will get wired together to create the Filecoin Forum. While each and every Space was incredible in its own way, the top Spaces best represent the Filecoin community and their needs. And since there were so many amazing builds submitted, Protocol Labs decided to expand the prize pool and number of build bounties.
