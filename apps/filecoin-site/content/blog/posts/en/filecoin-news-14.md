## Fleek Introduces Automatic Archiving

Fleek has announced that they are enabling automatic archiving on Filecoin for all sites and storage created on [**Fleek**](https://fleek.co/). This feature means Fleek users benefit from another degree of decentralization and permanence for anything they build with the protocol. Fleek’s support of Filecoin archiving means users who have websites or storage that run on IPFS with Fleek will now benefit from an automatic backup of all information on Filecoin. The v1 of Filecoin archiving on Fleek is just the beginning! Fleek continues to be a market leader in progressive decentralization for Web3, and we’re excited to support the team’s mission through IPFS and now Filecoin. [**Try Fleek**](https://app.fleek.co/) and benefit from Filecoin archiving at no cost to users. [**Read more about the integration in our recent blog post.**](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/the-next-phase-of-fleek-with-filecoin/)

## An Update from the Textile Team

For those who don’t know, [**Textile**](https://textile.io/) is a suite of tools and APIs to help you build on IPFS and Filecoin — our projects include [**Powergate**](https://github.com/textileio/powergate), [**Buckets**](https://github.com/textileio/textile), and [**Threads**](https://github.com/textileio/go-threads). We’ve got some awesome progress updates and ongoing projects to share, so ICYMI — last week we released Miner Index V1, and [**buckets**](https://github.com/textileio/go-buckets) have been split into their own repo, where we will now extend with a pinning API. Additionally, we are partnering with [**Protocol Labs**](https://protocol.ai/) to give away [**$25,000**](https://github.com/protocol/grants/blob/main/hackathons/gitcoin-gr9-hackathon/all-bounties.md) in grants to projects building on [**Textile's APIs**](https://docs.textile.io/) and open-source tools.

<h3 style="margin:2em 0 0 0">Leading Photography Service storing on IPFS & Filecoin</h3>

Taopaipai, a leading photography service in China, [**announced they will use IPFS/Filecoin to store the data of their photographs**](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/uHU4dNuC96YTh0_BydpH5A). As the world's leading O2O platform for photography, huge storage requirements have plagued Taopaipai, and distributed storage has become the solution.

"We really appreciate the unique privacy and security of the Filecoin network. Secondly, storing on Filecoin can greatly save the cost of storage. I think Filecoin storage is the gospel of the photography industry." - _Wang Chong, Taopaipai Founder_

## How storage and retrieval deals work on Filecoin

The Filecoin network achieves economies of scale by allowing anyone to participate as a storage provider. Currently the network is made up of [**hundreds of storage providers**](https://spacegap.github.io/) spread across the globe. Content addressing and cryptographic storage proofs verify that data is being stored correctly and securely over time on miners’ hardware, which creates a robust and reliable service.

Check out [**this blog post**](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/how-storage-and-retrieval-deals-work-on-filecoin/) that covers the basic stages of the two types of deals in Filecoin — storage deals and retrieval deals — and details their lifecycle.
