## Announcements

[![](/uploads/fil-blog-2022-08-24.webp)](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/zondax-brings-filecoin-to-ledger-live/)

### Zondax Brings Filecoin to Ledger Live

Filecoin is now available on [Ledger Live](https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live). Clients, Storage Providers, and other network participants can send and receive FIL directly from Ledger devices while their private keys remain secure and are never exposed to third parties. This new feature has been implemented thanks to a close collaboration between Protocol Labs and [Zondax](https://zondax.ch/), a software development team that has built over 45 solutions for the Ledger hardware wallet. [Learn more](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/zondax-brings-filecoin-to-ledger-live/) about keeping FIL in cold storage.

### The Filecoin Orbit Community’s Growth Around the Globe

Launched in early 2022, the Filecoin Orbit Community Program is composed of volunteers from around the globe who are passionate about Filecoin, IPFS, and the overall Filecoin ecosystem. These volunteers are working to educate others in their local communities about the Filecoin ecosystem and Web3 by hosting events and producing educational content. Throughout this spring and summer, Filecoin Orbit ambassadors hosted over 20 events in 10 unique locations, with over 2,500 attendees — a 300% increase in attendees from Q1, 2022! [Read along](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/the-filecoin-orbit-community-s-growth-around-the-globe/) and find out how the community continues to grow.

### The Filecoin Virtual Machine

The Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM) is an important step forward for the network and the community. Once it’s live during the first half of 2023, it will introduce programmability and EVM-compatible smart contracts to Filecoin. This means that the network will go beyond decentralized and persistent storage and now provide compute capabilities over its 18 EiB of available capacity. Learn more about what this means in HQ Han’s recent Twitter [thread](https://twitter.com/duckie_han/status/1562981171176153088?s=20&t=ORX2K9YsEh7AOJOTLZCRZQ).

### Hiring in Web3

Do web3 projects have a problem finding developers? Dietrich Ayala recently [told](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ninabambysheva/2022/08/29/web3-growth-stymied-by-scarcity-of-programmers/?sh=6f412fe37fa4) Forbes “a better question would be, is there actually a shortage of developers or is there a shortage of developers who are able to think about what the next generation of internet will look like? And that's a more challenging task from a recruiting standpoint.” Protocol Labs is currently hiring for 50 software engineering roles and has a steady stream of applications.
