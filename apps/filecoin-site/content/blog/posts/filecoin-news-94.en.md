### Spark Shows Significant Improvement in Retrievability of Public Data on Filecoin

Since May 2024, the FIL+ teamÂ has been advocating for the inclusion of retrieval data fromÂ [FIL Spark](https://filspark.com/)Â in datacap allocation decisions. This initiative has led to a significant increase in the retrieval success rate for Filecoin Storage Providers, as tracked by Spark, throughout the summer of 2024. Back in May, Spark measured zero storage providers (SPs) achieving a retrieval success rate above 90%, a benchmark we refer to as "one nine retrievability."

Fast forward to September 2024, and over 60 SPs have reached one nine retrievability, with four SPs achieving "two nines" retrievability (>99%). Remarkably, one SP even reached "three nines" retrievability (>99.9%)! For context, AWS S3 offers an availability SLA of "four nines" or 99.99%. Bravo to those SPs!Â 

As we build more trust in the availability and retrievability of public data stored on Filecoin via the Spark protocol and other protocols, Filecoin data clients will have more interest in the Filecoin network beyond just archival Storage, thus improving the product market fit of the network. VisitÂ [filspark.com](https://filspark.com/)Â for more information on Spark.Â

### Filecoin x io.net: Key Milestones and Future Opportunities

The Filecoin and io.net collaboration has made substantial progress in expanding the capabilities of decentralized storage over the past nine months. Key milestones include the onboarding of 1,500 GPUs from Filecoin Storage Providers, which unlocks new revenue streams through GPU computing for AI and ML tasks. The partnership's vision was shared at major events like the FIL Dev Summit in Singapore and FIL-Vegas, where io.netâ€™s CEO, Ahmad Shadid, highlighted the synergy between GPU computing and decentralized storage. With a community-driven approach, the collaboration empowers Storage Providers to diversify their services, bridging web2 and web3 ecosystems. As the collaboration advances, it opens up exciting new opportunities in AI and machine learning, creating synergies that enhance both infrastructure efficiency and economic viability for decentralized storage providers.Â [Read more](https://medium.com/@ykornida/recap-progress-of-the-filecoin-and-io-net-partnership-467df624e2e5)Â about the collaboration.Â
