## âœ¨ Highlights âœ¨

### The PDP Journey to Mainnet

The Filecoin ecosystem is taking a major step forward with Proof of Data Possession (PDP), a new mechanism designed to ensure data accessibility at specific points in time. PDP complements Proof of Replication (PoRep) by enabling efficient, periodic verification of stored data without the need for resource-intensive decoding. This is particularly useful for hot storage solutions like Storacha and Akave, which are among the first adopters of PDP.

A newly launched blog series, The PDP Journey, will document the progress of PDP toward Mainnet deployment, with key milestones ahead:

ðŸ”¹ February 2025: Final PDP contract optimizations, Curio-PDP pipeline development, and onramp integration with Storacha.
ðŸ”¹ March 2025: External audit, PDP explorer launch, and monitoring of storage provider performance.
ðŸ”¹ End of March 2025: PDP goes live on Mainnet! ðŸš€

To follow the journey, join the #fil-pdp channel on [Filecoin Slack](http://filecoin.io/slack). Read the [full blog post](https://medium.com/@filoz/the-pdp-journey-a-refresher-on-proof-of-data-possession-and-its-path-to-mainnet-e6b481d9ad9a).Â 

### â€‹â€‹Fast Finality (F3) Moves Closer to Mainnet with New Activation Mechanism

The F3 Journey continues with a major breakthrough: a new delegated authority mechanism that accelerates F3 activation on the Filecoin mainnet. Originally, F3 required two network upgrades, delaying activation until mid-2025. Now, a smart contract-based approach will allow the Filecoin implementation teams to set key F3 parameters on-chain, eliminating the need for a second upgrade while maintaining security and transparency. This new method ensures faster finalization, improved usability, and greater efficiency for the Filecoin network. The contract is live and open for community reviewâ€”[read the full update](https://medium.com/@filoz/the-f3-journey-delegated-authority-for-faster-mainnet-activation-of-f3-98f9aa69eb0c).

### FIP-00XX: Removing Batch Balancer & Introducing a Per-Sector Fee

[This proposal](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/irenegia-removeBatchBalancer/FIPS/fip-removeBatchBalancer.md) aims to improve the efficiency and economic sustainability of the Filecoin network by removing the batch balancer fee, replacing it with a per-sector fee, and eliminating outdated gas-limited constraints. By incentivizing sector batching and proof aggregation, this change reduces gas costs for Storage Providers (SPs) and enhances scalability. The new per-sector fee, based on circulating supply and sector duration, ensures fair value capture without adding upfront costs, while also allowing greater flexibility for future optimizations. Additionally, removing gas-based constraints simplifies protocol operations and removes barriers to network growth.
