The Filecoin community is excited to launch [FIL-RetroPGF-2](https://fil-retropgf.notion.site/FIL-RetroPGF-4b6f5358440043c8bb1bf53f0297541e), a grants initiative aimed at recognizing and rewarding impactful contributions to the Filecoin ecosystem. 

Projects that have demonstrated significant impact from April 2024 to September 2024 (inclusive) will have the chance to gain visibility, receive feedback, and be awarded funding. This round will progress through several key stages, each designed to allow projects to present their value and receive community support.

If you’ve been working to build on or contribute to the Filecoin network, this is your chance to get rewarded for your efforts. The process is open and transparent, and anyone can participate or support the initiative.

## Key Stages of FIL-RetroPGF Round 2

### Stage 1: [Project Showcase](https://fil-retropgf.notion.site/Project-Showcase-10ad0d646da18042b92fe942ebf41090)

_Dates: September 30, 2024 – October 14, 2024_

This phase gives projects a platform to highlight their impact on the Filecoin ecosystem. Projects can receive feedback from the organizing team, providing an opportunity for refinement before the formal intake process. If you've been building in the Filecoin space, this is your moment to showcase what you've accomplished over the last six months.

Here’s how to participate:

1. Submit a GitHub comment – In the [FIL-RetroPGF Round 2 thread](https://github.com/filecoin-project/community/discussions/714), briefly describe your project with the following details:
   - Project Name
   - Project Category
   - Brief 50-word description of your project
   - URL e.g. project website or github repo
2. Spread the word – Share your github submission on any social media platform while tagging the FIL-RetroPGF and Filecoin accounts (#filretropgf #filecoin) to engage the community and maximize visibility. Here is an example:

**_Important Note: Sharing your project on social media is a great way to spread the word about building in the Filecoin ecosystem. Badgeholders will be advised that increasing visibility this way is valuable, and be advised to take it into account as a factor when scoring projects._**

### Stage 2: Application Intake

_Dates: October 14, 2024 – November 4, 2024_

Once the Application Showcase concludes, projects will submit a more detailed intake form. This submission will help badgeholders (those tasked with evaluating projects) assess your project’s impact within the designated window of April 2024 to September 2024. Projects must clearly outline their contributions and impact within this form for consideration.

### Stage 3: Badgeholder Evaluation & Voting

_Dates: November 11, 2024 – November 25, 2024_

During this stage, the badgeholders will review all the submitted projects, evaluating their overall impact on the Filecoin ecosystem. Badgeholders will allocate funding to each project based on these assessments.

### Stage 4: Vote Aggregation, Funding Allocation and Distribution

_Estimated Start: December 2024_

The organizing committee will aggregate the votes from the badgeholders and allocate funding to projects accordingly. The amount of funding each project receives will be based on the badgeholders' collective decision. Once votes are finalized, projects will begin receiving their allocated funds through DRIPs in December.

This timeline can also be found permanently on the [Notion website](https://fil-retropgf.notion.site/Round-2-Timeline-103d0d646da180b2b7bcfb807032ae7c).

## Why Participate?

This RetroPGF round offers significant opportunities for teams and individuals working on Filecoin-related projects to gain support and recognition for their contributions. Not only is this an opportunity to gain financial backing, but it also serves as a platform to increase awareness of your project and engage with the broader Filecoin community. Through the Application Showcase and voting process, participants will receive valuable feedback that can help guide future development efforts.

Whether you’re directly involved in Filecoin or supporting the ecosystem through tools, services, or research, now is your chance to gain recognition and funding for your impact. Don't miss this opportunity!

Stay tuned for updates as the process unfolds and make sure to follow along with the #filretropgf hashtag on Twitter for community engagement and project showcases.
