Today, we are excited to announce the launch of the **Filecoin [ProPGF](https://fil-propgf.questbook.app/) prototype**, a pioneering on-chain funding program designed to support the development of public goods within the Filecoin ecosystem. This new initiative builds on the success of RetroPGF and aims to create a more transparent, decentralized, and community-driven approach to funding critical projects.

## What is [ProPGF](https://fil-propgf.questbook.app/)?

ProPGF is a proactive funding mechanism that identifies and supports both new and existing opportunities for public goods innovation. Working in tandem with RetroPGF, these prospective and retroactive programs will form a comprehensive community-run funding vehicle for public goods in the Filecoin ecosystem. The goal is to foster sustainable projects that align with community needs and priorities, enhancing the ecosystem's technology infrastructure and user base.

Below is the high-level roadmap for the development of ProPGF. Please remember that we are still in the development phase of this prototype so very much open to feedback. More Specifics on the rollout can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kFIvj7Zt80OI9_g9O7Oy01Qnf8q_wRyUKEbHKYtfmVo/edit#slide=id.g33221d25282_0_3167).

**Phase 1: Prototype** → develop the structure and onchain tech stack for the program with Filecoin community feedback

**Phase 2: Onchain Community Involvement** →incorporate direct community onchain voting for funding recipients in the program

**Phase 3: Onchain Funding Mechanism** → build in network based funding structures to support the program for the long term

- [Formal applications](https://fil-propgf.questbook.app/) open the week of March 31st 
- Application period closes (Late April)
- Proposals reviewed and early decisions made (Early May)

## Key Features of [ProPGF](https://fil-propgf.questbook.app/)

- **Community Governance**: ProPGF incorporates a selection committee composed of subject matter experts from the Filecoin ecosystem, ensuring that funding decisions are informed by community insights.
- **On-Chain Transparency**: Utilizing tools like [Snapshot](https://snapshot.box) for voting and [Questbook](https://www.questbook.xyz/) for grant management, ProPGF ensures public, on-chain visibility of applications, reviews, and funding commitments.
