title: "Filecoin, IPFS, libp2p Ecosystem WG: October 2022 All Hands Recap"
_template: blog_detail
---

The Ecosystem WG is a collection of 100+ people across 6+ organizations that are passionate about the long-term adoption of web3 and dedicated to growing the Filecoin, IPFS, and libp2p ecosystems. Every month the working group gathers to share the latest updates, highlights, and deep-dives on what’s happening across the ecosystem.

There’s a lot to cover for October ‘22, so get some coffee and settle in to watch a quick [recap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D2nR15Rnk0) of everything that happened. Or if you prefer reading, find the details below.

## The Network’s Fast-Paced Growth

The [ecosystem updates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m92LjE7Qa1w) show that decentralized storage adoption is not slowing down anytime soon. The Filecoin Network continues to grow with a continual increase in the amount of data being stored on the network, and a executing a higher capacity of deals.

- Storage capacity remained at a whopping 18.8 EiB
- Data stored on the network grew 76 PiB, from 139 PiB to 215 PiB
- Over 1.2 million deals were closed this month, for a total of 8 million

An important part of this progress has been the onboarding of over 1,000 unique web2 clients, 15% of which have uploaded over 100 TiB of data. This is aside from the network’s most popular use cases which include the storage of over 92.7 million NFTs — a 6.7 million jump from last month!

## Shining a Spotlight on What’s Happening Across the Ecosystem

Numbers only tell half the story. The ecosystem has been active lately with events, developments, and new projects building with Filecoin. Watch the [Spotlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRV_edxdtjQ&t=2s) section to learn more about them.

**FIL-Singapore** was a blast. Over 1,600 builders attended the event and many more tuned in to [watch online](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLp3zrT1ewY0mCYYgHEVsRnqGwRYA3I-9x). The event featured a keynote address from Juan Benet and a [fireside chat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ZecMxYhFE) with former presidential candidate Andrew Yang.

**FILVC Demo Day** was also a huge success. The first-ever event attracted over 300 investors who heard from 26 startups building in the web3 and decentralized storage ecosystem. Stay tuned to the [Filecoin Slack](https://filecoin.io/slack) for more information on the next one.

**The FEVM stream** on Twitch was a quick way to get started on the ongoing developments of the FVM roadmap. The [live-coding video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOcaMaxiEYw) walked builders through the process of deploying a Solidity smart contract on the Filecoin Ethereum Virtual Machine.

**The Storage Provider Sales Kit** is an important resource containing battle cards, email templates, client presentations, and client FAQs developed to help you grow your SP operations. It also includes an interesting [case study](https://hub.filecoin.io/case-study-greaterheat) featuring SP Greaterheat. [Sign up](https://hub.filecoin.io/resources) to gain access.

**The Storage Provider Lenders Page** is the place to go for funds that help finance SP operations. Some lenders include CoinList, Anchorage Digital Bank, and Darma Capital.

**Fileverse** is an open source, private, easy-to-use, on-chain tool for collaboration between blockchain addresses. It works like a WeTransfer of GoogleDrive that’s built on IPFS’ robust p2p infrastructure. [Take a look](https://fileverse.io/) and start using Fileverse.

**SuperFun** is a creator-owned social platform focused on memes and fun content. The platform relies on Filecoin for the decentralized storage of all its data.

Finally, take some time to hear an in-depth explanation of other important developments in the ecosystem.

**Zondax**’s research and development went into everything that’s going on with the development of a [Filecoin Virtual Machine Assemblyscript SDK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyMPFwxmfDo).

**Glitter Protocol**, an open content indexing protocol on Filecoin, shared new [work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK53IkDo-cQ) on improving data curation on decentralized networks.

**Starboard** showcased [Spacescope](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqZ3Ep1cNXI), a community-powered network intelligence protocol that produces accessible and verifiable APIs for blockchain network activities.
