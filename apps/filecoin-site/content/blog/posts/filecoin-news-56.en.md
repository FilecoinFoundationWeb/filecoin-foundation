### Filecoin Network v17 Shark ðŸ¦ˆ Upgrade is Coming

The upcoming Filecoin upgrade to network version 17, Shark ðŸ¦ˆ, will bring a range of improvements and simplifications that set the stage for programmable storage: smart contracts that interact with storage deals and providers. This is currently expected to be the last upgrade before the February launch of the [FEVM (EVM runtime on FVM)](https://fvm.filecoin.io/) slated for [network version 18](https://github.com/filecoin-project/core-devs/discussions/115). Get the full list of FIPs that will be activated in version 17 in [this blog post](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/filecoin-network-v17-shark-upgrade/) and hear more about them on the July 2022 [PL EngRes All Hands deep dive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQTPUE4MN_4&list=PLhuBigpl7lqtkWt7koiW6SvQKzT_O4bvY&index=13).

### The Filecoin Masterplan

Where is Filecoin going in the short-term and long-term future? Filecoin and IPFS are a foundational part of the web3 stack. The community has worked hard to build the worldâ€™s largest decentralized storage network and onboard and safeguard humanityâ€™s data. Now, it plans to bring retrieval and compute capabilities to the data to build scalable applications. Learn more about the vision for Filecoin on the [blog](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/the-filecoin-masterplan/) or by watching Juan Benetâ€™s [keynote presentation](https://youtu.be/oY1ot0qD0Rw) at FIL-Singapore.

### Is Crypto Good for the World?

Juan Benet and the Filecoin community thinks so. This is always a timely question, especially when the distinctions between different sectors of the space need to be emphasized. Juan joined Banklessâ€™s David Hoffman to discuss topics like DeFi vs CeFi, positive externalities, and all the ways in which builders in web3 can make crypto good for the world with decentralized infrastructure and cryptographic primitives.
