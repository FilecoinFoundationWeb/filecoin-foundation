## ✨ Highlights ✨

### 🚀 Network Version 26 Is Live

Network v26 completes the rollout of [FIP-0100](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0100.md), ending the 90-day grace period for extending older sectors. From now on, extensions on pre-FIP-0100 sectors will incur a new daily fee based on quality-adjusted power and FIL supply.

The good news? Aggregation brings major gas savings. With the batch balancer removed, batching PreCommits and aggregating ProveCommits can cut costs by 2–4x per sector. SPs already making the switch are seeing real results.
