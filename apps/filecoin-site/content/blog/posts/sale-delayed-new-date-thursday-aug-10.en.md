Hey Everyone,

Bad news. We unfortunately have to delay the sale. This is painful — for us, as much as anybody else — but it is necessary. We are doing many, many things for the first time, and this sale will be a landmark event in the space. As a reminder, the original Ethereum sale pushed back several times before their launch. Rockets delay their launches all the time. Ultimately, it’s much better to get these things absolutely right. This is a one-time event, and there is no turning back.

Here are the reasons to delay:

- Since we sent out the [averaging first investments update yesterday](https://ipfs.tech/), we’ve received many emails and comments in various forums noting that making this change, so close to the sale, is really hard on investors, who need time to re-evaluate it. _(We agree with this.)_
- We think it’s important to give people more time to evaluate this change, and get comfortable with it — these are important investing decisions, and we feel very strongly that nobody should invest without understanding the details in full.

Let’s use the time wisely between now and then.

- This will give us time to answer more questions — send us all questions you have today, so we can provide answers for everyone tomorrow (we will post a new FAQ or something like it). Please email [filecoin-sale@protocol.ai](mailto:filecoin-sale@protocol.ai).
- We will write some more posts, describing the economics in more detail.
- Please write to us with any and all concerns.

**Also, a warning: we have seen multiple fake, scam websites pretending to be the Filecoin Sale. Stay away, and know that the sale will ONLY happen through** [**CoinList.co**](https://coinlist.co/)

Thank you,

The Filecoin Team.
