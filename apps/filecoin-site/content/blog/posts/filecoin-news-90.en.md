## ‚ú® Highlights ‚ú®

### Network Version 23 - [Waffle Update](https://github.com/filecoin-project/community/discussions/74#discussioncomment-9866172)

Get ready for the latest network upgrade, [nv23](https://github.com/filecoin-project/community/discussions/74#discussioncomment-9866172), codenamed Waffle! Rolling out on Mainnet on August 6, 2024, this update brings several key improvements to the Filecoin network, enhancing performance and unlocking new capabilities.

Key Filecoin Improvement Proposals (FIPs) in NV23:

1. Soft Launch of Fast Finality (F3) - FIP-00086:
   - Enables passive F3 testing on mainnet.
   - Sets the stage for fast finality in future upgrades, with a potential full rollout in nv24.
2. Support for Legacy Ethereum Transactions - FIP-0091:
   - Adds support for Homestead and EIP-155 Ethereum transactions.
   - Enhances compatibility with Ethereum tools and wallets.
   - Eases onboarding for Ethereum users and improves interoperability with the Ethereum ecosystem.
3. Non-Interactive Proof of Replication (NI-PoRep) - FIP-0092:
   - Introduces a significant change to the sector sealing process.
   - Separates sealing from storage tasks, allowing independent execution.
   - Enables early sealing in regions with lower energy costs.
   - Gives storage providers control over scheduling their sectors for window post deadlines.

What This Means for the Filecoin Network

- Enhanced Performance: NI-PoRep makes adding storage easier and more cost-effective, potentially accelerating network growth.
- Broader Ecosystem Integration: Support for legacy Ethereum transactions opens new cross-chain application possibilities.
- Faster, More Efficient Network: The soft launch of F3 is the first step towards significantly reducing transaction confirmation times.

Stay tuned for more updates as we approach the launch of [Network version 23 - Waffle](https://github.com/filecoin-project/community/discussions/74#discussioncomment-9866172). This upgrade is set to enhance Filecoin‚Äôs capabilities, efficiency, and integration with the broader blockchain ecosystem!
