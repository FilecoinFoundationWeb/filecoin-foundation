title: The Filecoin Orbit Community’s Growth Around the Globe
_template: blog_detail
---

Launched in early 2022, the Filecoin Orbit Community Program is composed of volunteers from around the globe who are passionate about Filecoin, IPFS, and the overall Filecoin ecosystem. These [volunteers](https://filecoinfoundation.medium.com/meet-orbit-community-program-ambassadors-6bd92a4b974) are working to educate others in their local communities about the Filecoin ecosystem and Web3 by hosting events and producing educational content.

Throughout this spring and summer, Filecoin Orbit ambassadors hosted over 20 events in 10 unique locations, with over 2,500 attendees — a 300% increase in attendees from Q1, 2022! This momentum would not be possible without the efforts of our volunteer ambassadors and the communities that they have worked so hard to build.
