### Introducing the Browsers 3000 Hackathon

The IPFS and Filecoin communities are excited to announce the [**Browsers 3000 Hackathon**](https://fil.org/events), beginning July 8 and running through September 21, 2021! This hackathon is a six week virtual event to explore and accelerate the development of web3 in the browser through experimentation and challenge prizes.

It kicks off with a one day summit with speakers from your favorite browser makers and other projects building browser infrastructure for web3 and P2P technologies today, and will include workshops and presentations up until the show-and-tell demo and awards ceremony in September. [**Visit the Browsers 3000 website to learn more and sign up to be notified when registration opens!**](https://fil.org/events/)

<h3 style="padding-top: 20px;">Filecoin Next Step Microgrants</h3>

[**Filecoin Next Step Microgrants**](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/blob/master/Program%20Resources/Microgrants%20README.md) are now available to support taking the Next Step after building an initial prototype with Filecoin. They are offered with the understanding that decentralized technologies are a rapidly developing field with many unknowns. Next Step Microgrants seek to match the pace, breadth, and experimental nature of this work. These grants are intended for independent developers, small studios, non-profits, activists, researchers... and you! Next Step Microgrants are awarded in the amount of $5,000, paid in FIL tokens. The entire grant amount be used to support work related to integrating or improving Filecoin, such as developer time, hosting services, relevant hardware, etc. To learn more about the program qualifications, timelines, FAQ, and how to apply, [**read here**](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/blob/master/Program%20Resources/Microgrants%20README.md).

### OpenSea stores NFTs with IPFS and Filecoin

[**OpenSea**](https://opensea.io/) recently [**launched**](https://opensea.io/blog/announcements/decentralizing-nft-metadata-on-opensea/) a feature to “freeze” NFT metadata, enabling NFT creators to properly decentralize their NFTs using IPFS and Filecoin. OpenSea is one of the largest NFT marketplaces in the web3 space, creating a market for millions of NFTs today. Using IPFS and Filecoin, NFT creators that use OpenSea can now create immutable NFT metadata using IPFS [**content addressing**](https://blog.ipfs.tech/2021-04-05-storing-nfts-on-ipfs/) and [**provable and decentralized storage with Filecoin**](https://blog.ipfs.tech/2021-06-03-ipfs-filecoin-content-persistence/).

### Filecoin Mining Working Group

The Filecoin Foundation has launched the Filecoin Mining Working Group (MWG), a voluntary working group that allows Filecoin miners of all sizes to work collaboratively with other esteemed miners on the Filecoin network. Through partnerships with local miners in North America, Europe, and Asia, the MWG aims to improve the mining experience for all Filecoin miners while also providing resources and education to bridge gaps between Filecoin miners and Filecoin developers, storage providers, and the broader community worldwide.

### Lotus & Retrieval Markets Builders Summit

Recently, the Filecoin community hosted the [**Retrieval Market Builders Mini-Summit**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuE_NotFCXs&list=PL_0VrY55uV19TsJ8r2qsMyG2v2LIKEmv2), an event to gather all the builders of the multiple Retrieval Market solutions, highlight the progress made so far and identify how the multiple systems can come together in a way to increase the retrieval deals efficacy, efficiency and reliability for users of the network. At the summit, [**Raul Kripalani**](https://github.com/raulk) (libp2p and Filecoin core dev) led a deep dive on the architecture of a Lotus node and the changes planned, specifically to the lotus-miner nodes, to better fit the needs of miners and network participants. For a full recap of his talk on the Evolution of a Lotus Node, [**read this recent blog post**](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/the-evolution-of-a-lotus-node/).

### **Mining Energy Questionnaire**

Calling all Filecoin miners - we are still looking for community members to complete the [Filecoin Mining Energy Questionnaire](https://filecoin-community.typeform.com/to/yTMkOLg8). Help us improve ecosystem initiatives and community support by participating in this [short survey](https://filecoin-community.typeform.com/to/yTMkOLg8) - we’d be very grateful for your input. Thank you for your ongoing work to strengthen the community.

### Lotus v1.10.0 and actor v5

The Lotus team is pleased to announce the release of Lotus v1.10.0, which introduces the HyperDrive network upgrade to the Filecoin protocol on Wednesday, June 30th, 2021. The release, which uses v5 of the specs-actors and v8.0.2 of rust-fil-proofs, implements the following FIPs:

- [**FIP-0008**](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0008.md): Add miner batched sector pre-commit method
- [**FIP-0011**](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0011.md): Remove reward auction from reporting consensus faults
- [**FIP-0012**](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0012.md): DataCap Top up for FIL+ Client Addresses
- [**FIP-0013**](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0013.md): Add ProveCommitSectorAggregated method to reduce on-chain congestion
- [**FIP-0015**](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0015.md): Revert FIP-0009(Exempt Window PoSts from BaseFee burn).

The chief highlight is FIP-0013, which uses the new SnarkPack technology to allow for aggregating many proofs when onboarding new storage onto the Filecoin network. It is hoped that this will allow for a 10-25x increase in the rate at which useful storage can be pledged to the network.

Watch the network upgrade at epoch 892800 -- 22:00 UTC on Wednesday, June 30th, 2021!

### Proofs v8.0.2 (final HyperDrive release!)

The Proofs release v8.0.2 contains the finalized features for the Hyperdrive initiative. This includes a new API to interact with [**SnarkPack**](https://research.protocol.ai/blog/2021/snarkpack-how-to-aggregate-snarks-efficiently/), a system to efficiently generate a single proof from a number of other previously generated SNARK proofs. This can help enable on-chain scaling by requiring a smaller number of replication proofs, as proof aggregation can conceptually be thought of as a data compression technique. The new proofs release further exposes the SnarkPack API to verify these aggregate proofs, which ensures that all of the original input proofs are verified properly, rather than having to verify each one individually. [**Read more about how SnarkPack works**](https://research.protocol.ai/blog/2021/snarkpack-how-to-aggregate-snarks-efficiently/).

### Filecoin Launchpad Accelerator II

This week Tachyon kicked off Filecoin Launchpad Accelerator II. 20 companies, 55 founders, from 11 countries across 4 continents. These are some of the brightest and most innovative founders building in web3. The projects touch NFTs, DeFi, dev tools, social, gaming, and infrastructure. The 12-week intensive accelerator program will culminate with a demo day in September 2021, please stay tuned for more details.

### HyperDrive Deep Dive + AMA 2 Recap

The HyperDrive upgrade is quickly approaching, so last week Filecoin CryptoEcon Engineer ZX hosted a deep dive to explain its significance and key features. The HyperDrive upgrade will unlock a 10-25x increase in storage capacity, which is done through reducing the unit storage GasUsage of BatchCommit messages. Additionally, the upgrade will allow for reduced mining costs thanks to the reduced unit storage cost, faster network growth as miners capitalize on gas cost reductions, cheaper deals, whole network benefits, and cooperative competition as miners are incentivized to outpace the network.

In the deep dive session, ZX highlighted:

- Gas and BaseFees, and how these concepts explain Network Transaction Fees
- Why the Network Transaction Fee is burned
- What Cooperative Competition is, and why it matters
- The math behind Quality Adjusted Power, or QAP
- Incentive Issues like Miner Fairness
- FIP13 Gas Changes
- Gas Charges, and Batch Balancer & Batch Discounts
- BaseFee Balancing Dynamics
