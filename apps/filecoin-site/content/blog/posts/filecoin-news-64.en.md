### **GLIF**

Filecoin’s DeFi ecosystem is growing with the help of [GLIF](https://glif.io/en). GLIF recently announced the opening of the Infinity Pool - the first non-custodial, fully automated leasing pool for Filecoin.The Infinity Pool operates like a leasing mechanism - Filecoin Storage Providers rent FIL from the pool for extended periods of time, and make weekly payments depending on the amount of leased FIL. It is built on GLIF Pools - a unique and innovative protocol for deploying custom leasing pools to Filecoin. The Infinity Pool and underlying GLIF Pools protocol pave the way to a vibrant and healthy DeFi ecosystem on Filecoin. Expect to see more exciting announcements from the GLIF team in the coming weeks.

### **FVM Imaginarium: Cross-chain Interoperability**

The Filecoin Network has taken a significant leap forward in cross-chain interoperability with the mainnet launch of messaging and token bridging solutions by [Axelar](https://axelar.network/how-axelar-works) and [Celer Network](https://celer.network/). These integrations enable seamless communication and asset transfers between Filecoin and 30+ other leading Web3 chains such as Polygon, Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche and more. Interoperable networks allow Filecoin to export its competitive services such as data compute and storage, to applications on other chains. This approach gives dapps on all chains the ability to take advantage of thousands of Filecoin storage providers, resources, and future subnets for their data needs. Learn more in this [deep dive](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/the-fvm-imaginarium-cross-chain-interoperability/). Get started with [cBridge, powered by Celer Network](https://cbridge.celer.network/1/56/USDC) or [Satellite token transfer](https://testnet.satellite.money/?source=filecoin&destination=ethereum&asset_denom=fil&destination_address=), powered by Axelar now!
