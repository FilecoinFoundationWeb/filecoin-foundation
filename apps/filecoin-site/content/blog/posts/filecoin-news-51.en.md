### FIP-0036

FIPs are standards specifying potential new features or processes for Filecoin. Among other features, the upcoming FIP-0036 would introduce a sector duration multiplier for long-term sector commitments. The community recently hosted an AMA to further discuss the details of the proposal. Watch a [full recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6T4AiOpxJU) of the session to learn more.

Given the feedback and conversation that FIP0036 has generated, Filecoin governance stewards will be running a poll to determine community consensus. For more information, see the #fil-fips channel on Slack or view the [governance documentation](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/discussions/464).

### Large Datasets: Kernelogic

Kernelogic started as an individual Storage Provider effort that evolved into the role of a large dataset client via the Slingshot competition. The project focuses on scripts that prepare open datasets into fixed-sized sectors that Filecoin can store. It then transfers these datasets to SPs who are interested in storing them. Over the course of its operations, Kernelogic has onboarded over 10 PiB of useful and verified datasets by making storage deals with over 50 different SPs from across the globe. [Find out more](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/large-datasets-kernelogic/) about these datasets.
