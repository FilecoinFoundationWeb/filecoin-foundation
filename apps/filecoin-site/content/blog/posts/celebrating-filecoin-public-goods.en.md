_The Filecoin protocol and its underlying technology are critical public goods that thousands of stakeholders rely on around the world. Today we celebrate 10+ teams committed to the decentralization and preservation of public goods tools & infrastructure, the new FIL RetroPGF program rewarding new public goods contributions, and the ongoing commitment from major Filecoin supporters towards advancing the growth of public goods in the Filecoin Ecosystem._

## The Filecoin Network and Community have Grown Massively since 2020

The Filecoin network has seen tremendous growth since mainnet launch in October 2020, and today is the world‚Äôs largest decentralized storage network. The diverse ecosystem of Filecoin Storage Providers, Developers, Data Clients, Token Holders and Ecosystem Partners is global and expanding.¬†

- Around **3,000 Storage Providers are storing humanity‚Äôs most valuable information** and providing cryptographic proofs to verify storage on Filecoin.
- **Over 1,800 data clients, from CERN to Solana to the Internet Archive, are storing their data on the Filecoin network, totaling nearly 2 EiB of data!**¬†
- There are millions of unique network stakeholders, and **thousands who are [leasing their tokens](https://fvm.starboard.ventures/explorer/leaderboard) to enable more decentralized storage services.**
- **[Hundreds of successful, independent ecosystem teams and projects from around the world](https://fil.org/ecosystem-explorer)** are building on or with the Filecoin ecosystem to further enhance its utility.¬†
- **Important community enablement and governance systems are funded and maintained by many teams, including [Filecoin Foundation](https://fil.org/)** (‚ÄúFF‚Äù) which helps steward [grant programs](https://fil.org/grants/), the [Filecoin Improvement Proposal Process](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs), and the [Orbit Community Ambassador program](https://hub.fil.org/orbit).¬†¬†

## Hundreds of Teams Invest in Public Goods for the Filecoin Community

Over the past 3+ years, the Filecoin community has come together to create and fund many programs, tools, and systems to advance network development and growth. [Filecoin Foundation](http://fil.org/) and [Protocol Labs](http://protocol.ai/) have participated actively in this community, along with many other key stakeholders such as GLIF, Web3mine, Titan, IPFS Force, ChainSafe, and many others who continually dedicate energy and resources to ensuring the development, availability, and maintenance of critical public goods that advance both Filecoin and the decentralized web at large. To name a few:

- **OSS Repos, Tools, and Docs**: Over the years, Protocol Labs has helped grow and develop many critical OSS building blocks used by Filecoin - such as [IPNI](https://github.com/ipni) and [Boost](https://boost.filecoin.io/), [Drand](http://drand.love/), the [Filecoin Docs](https://docs.filecoin.io/), along with specs & implementations for [IPFS](http://ipfs.io/), [libp2p](http://libp2p.io/), [Multiformats](http://multiformats.io/) and many other OSS projects that now power Filecoin and many other blockchains.
- **Filecoin Implementations Development**: Developers from around the world have been adding to and updating components of the Filecoin stack for years. For example, 3 separate [client implementations](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/announcing-lotus-our-first-alternate-filecoin-implementation/) join together to enhance the network‚Äôs resilience by bringing client diversity to the network and continuously supporting protocol evolution:¬† [Lotus](https://lotus.filecoin.io), the reference implementation in Go, has been maintained by a team within Protocol Labs since pre-mainnet launch; [Venus](https://venus.filecoin.io/), another Go implementation, is stewarded by the [IPFSForce](https://github.com/ipfs-force-community) team; [Forest](https://github.com/ChainSafe/forest), a Rust implementation, was created by [ChainSafe](https://chainsafe.io/).
- **Critical Ecosystem Tooling**: Many network teams have built critical tooling to set a solid foundation for the network‚Äôs liveness and visibility, and to enable builders to develop applications on Filecoin. For example, [Starboard](https://www.starboard.ventures/) received funding from FF to build out the [Filecoin Network Health Dashboard](https://dashboard.starboard.ventures/dashboard) and the [Filecoin DeFi Leaderboard](https://fvm.starboard.ventures/explorer/leaderboard). Additionally, Zondax was supported to create [Beryx](https://beryx.zondax.ch/), a Filecoin ecosystem explorer. Multiple GLIF projects are also building interoperable apps and development tools for the network, including the Explorer, [Wallet](https://www.glif.io/en/wallet), and [RPC APIs](https://api.node.glif.io/).
- **Helping Onboard Humanity‚Äôs Most Important Data to Filecoin**: While most data stored on Filecoin is independently onboarded via Storage Providers or Data Clients, some of these public datasets are supported via grants from PL, FF, or others - including [Solana‚Äôs chain history](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/filecoin-news-83/), data from the [Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute](https://www.victorchang.edu.au/news/data-storage), and data associated with [Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence Institute](https://destor.com/seti). [The Decentralized Storage Alliance (DSA)](https://dsalliance.io/) is also helping spearhead architecture for decentralized storage use cases.¬†
- **Builder Programs & Community Events**: Filecoin is a global community and as a result, needs global gatherings to connect the ecosystem. Hundreds of teams across the community have joined forces to host and sponsor events, workshops, and seminars all around the world including: [Fil Dev Summits](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/empowering-a-decentralized-future-join-us-at-the-fil-dev-summit-2023/); FIL-City Events (e.g., [FIL Vegas](https://fil-vegas.io/), FIL Hong Kong, FIL Bangalore); major conferences (e.g., Consensus, ETHDenver, and EthCC); [LabWeeks](https://23.labweek.io/); [Filecoin Orbit](https://orbit.filecoin.io/) community events; and more. This also includes programs to reach the broader web3 developer audience through hackathons, incubators, and builder programs. In 2023 alone, Filecoin (and the [Filecoin Virtual Machine](https://fvm.filecoin.io/)) was featured in over 20 hackathons and formed partnerships with major accelerators including [Tachyon](https://tachyon.xyz/), [Graph Paper Capital](https://www.graphpapercapital.xyz/), and [ETHGlobal](https://ethglobal.com/)!

As a community, continually investing in the growth and maintenance of Filecoin public goods is critical for the long-term success and health of the ecosystem. To achieve this, many teams have formed in the last year with exactly this purpose: **creating, growing, and maintaining Filecoin public goods**.

## Highlighting 10 Public Goods Teams Dedicated to Maintaining & Growing Filecoin

## Scaling and Supporting more Filecoin Public Goods Initiatives

In addition to the valuable initiatives, tooling, and teams described above - the Filecoin community has a new resource in its arsenal to attract, reward, and sustain Public Goods initiatives in the ecosystem! The [FIL-RetroPGF-1](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/unveiling-fil-retropgf-1-retroactively-funding-filecoin-public-goods/) funding round (inspired by [Optimism‚Äôs RetroPGF](https://retropgf.com/)) was launched in early March 2024 to further support and fund the growth of Filecoin Public Goods. Over 100 teams were [nominated](https://github.com/filecoin-project/community/discussions/689) by the community to apply for retroactive funding to reward impactful contributions to the Filecoin ecosystem! To learn more about the program, we invite interested parties to watch [this talk from the latest FIL Dev Summit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wT9YeFemzPA%5c&list=PL_0VrY55uV1_88_dDYcGmhCcK6Y3eRhRJ%5c&index=11) at ETH Denver or get involved in [#fil-retropgf](https://filecoinproject.slack.com/archives/C06KSDK0811/p1715072615486319?thread_ts=1715054530.822599&cid=C06KSDK0811) on Filecoin Slack.¬†

New ways to improve public goods funding best practices were also discussed at [LabWeek Public Goods](https://www.labweek.io/24-pg), a decentralized conference hosted by Protocol Labs & the Foresight Institute in SF in April 2024. The first-of-its-kind LabWeek [brought together experts](https://protocol.ai/blog/labweek-public-goods-funding-sustainability-decentralized-science/) to discuss how to support essential resources for a better funded, sustainable, and fairer digital future. Recaps of talks and presentations from the week-long event will be posted to the [LabWeek schedule](https://www.labweek.io/24-pg/schedule/calendar).¬†
