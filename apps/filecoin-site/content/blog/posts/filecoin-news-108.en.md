## ✨ Highlights ✨

### Filecoin’s NV25 Teep Network Upgrade is Here

The Filecoin network has officially launched its NV25 “Teep” upgrade, bringing major improvements to network efficiency, economics, and developer tooling. Key changes include simplified per-sector fees (FIP-0100), support for transient storage via EIP-1153 (FIP-0097), a fixed-percentage sector termination fee (FIP-0098), and preparations for the upcoming F3 fast finality upgrade. Together, these updates make Filecoin more flexible, predictable, and accessible for storage providers, developers, and clients alike. With NV25 live, the community now looks ahead to F3 activation, which promises a 450x boost in transaction finality speed.

### Shaping the Next Era of AI and Decentralized Storage: April 2025 Update

In the April 2025 Quarterly Update, the Filecoin Foundation highlights how Filecoin is becoming essential infrastructure for the future of AI and decentralized technologies. As the AI industry grows to $9 trillion, projects like Recall, Theoriq, Ungate AI, and AIWS are building on Filecoin’s verifiable storage to ensure transparency, trust, and resilience. Across the broader ecosystem, organizations like The Defiant, the Flickr Foundation, and the Internet Archive are safeguarding cultural archives with Filecoin, while new collaborations with Blockfrost are bringing decentralization to Cardano apps. The Foundation also continues to fuel innovation through developer grants, support for builders in APAC, governance initiatives like FIP milestones, and major network upgrades like NV25 and Fast Finality (F3). Together, these efforts strengthen Filecoin’s role as the backbone for a more open, transparent, and decentralized digital future.

### Announcing the ProPGF Selection Committee: Strategy and Approach

The Filecoin ecosystem has launched the ProPGF program, ushering in a new era of community-led public goods funding. Central to this initiative is the ProPGF Selection Committee, a \~12-member, expert-driven group tasked with guiding funding decisions during the program’s 2025 prototype phase. Prioritizing transparency, diversity, and integrity, the committee brings together leaders from across the Filecoin and broader crypto ecosystems and will leverage on-chain tools like Snapshot and Questbook for decision-making. Stay tuned for the full committee announcement next week and learn how you can get involved in shaping the future of public goods funding in Filecoin.
