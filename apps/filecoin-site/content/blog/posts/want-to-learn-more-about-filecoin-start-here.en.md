Just in time for back to school, we’re here to get you up to speed on all things Filecoin. The following “syllabus” of instructional videos and materials covers all aspects of the Filecoin network – from mining to storage to application development. This resource is designed for anyone interested in learning about the history and development of the network, as well as how to leverage the network at all levels: mining, building, and storing.

## Filecoin Fundamentals

[**Using Lotus to connect to the Filecoin network**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dkzLJuv1jc&list=PLXzKMXK2aHh43-aCLLuGnny7nhnsf49LO&index=14&t=0s)

Lotus, the reference implementation of the Filecoin protocol, is your path to connecting to the Filecoin network and interacting with your peers! In this interactive workshop, we’ll go over the architecture of Lotus, walk through installing Lotus and syncing the blockchain, and examine how you can explore Filecoin’s functionality through the Lotus node.

**Supplemental Materials:**
_Length: 1 hour_

[**Textile’s Tools for the Filecoin Network**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ8M9m9_uJY)

Textile provides a suite of open-source tools that provide a decentralized database, IPFS-based storage, content hosting, and more, over libp2p, IPFS, and Filecoin. This workshop covers how to use Textile’s Threads, Buckets, and Hub tools to build apps for the Filecoin network (focus on JavaScript). The session includes an introduction to Textile’s suites of tools, basic command-line (CLI) actions, and Textile’s JavaScript Client(s). To prepare, we encourage you to install a few things before we get started:

- [Install](https://docs.textile.io/hub/accounts/) the Textile Hub command line interface (CLI) on your computer (so that you can connect to Textile’s Hub via the Hub CLI tools).
- [Set up Node.js](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs) on your computer

[**Intro to Textile’s Powergate**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiOTSkz_6aY)

Textile’s Powergate is an API-driven solution for deploying multitiered storage across Filecoin and IPFS. Persistent storage on Filecoin allows rich storage configuration for data, such as replication factor, miner selection, deal renewal, and repair. Network available storage is configurable and provided through a connected IPFS peer or pinning network.
