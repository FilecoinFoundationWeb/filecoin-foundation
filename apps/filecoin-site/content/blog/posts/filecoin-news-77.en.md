## Announcements

### Messari’s State of Filecoin Q3 2023 Report is now live

In its [latest report](https://messari.io/report/state-of-filecoin-q3-2023), Messari breaks down the current state of Filecoin - here are some highlights! In Q3 2023, Filecoin witnessed a 45% surge in storage demand, reaching 1,381 PiB in active storage deals, indicating strong interest in decentralized storage. Storage utilization also grew from 7.6% to 12.6% due to increased deals and reduced capacity. Filecoin attracted Web2 clients for cost-effective archival data storage, with 1,891 clients, including major institutions and Web3 platforms. The Retrieval Market, supported by Project Saturn, operates with over 1,800 geographically distributed nodes. Additionally, Filecoin's DeFi sector gained momentum, with smart contract-based lending and staking apps, attracting 2,900 stakers and $30 million in deposits in Q3, signaling a promising future for DeFi on the Filecoin network.

## Community 

### MIT Open Learning will upload OpenCourseWare to the Filecoin Network

Last week, MIT Open Learning announced it will start uploading OpenCourseWare (OCW) materials to the Filecoin network. In collaboration with Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web (FFDW), Open Learning will explore how DWeb technologies can support preservation and distribution of education materials. OCW offers free, accessible web-based materials from more than 2,500 MIT courses, and these materials have reached more than 500 million people worldwide since the program’s launch in 2002. [Learn more](https://ffdweb.org/blog/ffdw-supports-mit-open-learning-in-preserving-humanity-s-most-important-information/).

### Filecoin Tokenomics

In just three years, Filecoin has grown to become the largest decentralized storage network in the world. This growth is based largely on robust tokenomics that incentivize participation from the Filecoin community - an interconnected network of Storage Clients, Developers, Storage Providers (SP’s), Ecosystem Partners, and Token Holders. Get your Filecoin tokenomics overview in the [latest video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5a3714RzjE) from the FilecoinTLDR team.
