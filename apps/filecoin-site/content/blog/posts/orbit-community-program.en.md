We are excited to announce the launch of the Orbit Community Program powered by Protocol Labs and the Filecoin Foundation. The search has begun for community leaders and advocates across the world to join the broader Web3 community. Candidates who become Orbit Community Program **Cadets** (the individual track) or **Spaceships** (the enterprise track) will help spread the word about next-generation Web3 solutions and grow their local communities. Applications [are open now](https://orbitcommunity.filecoin.io/)!

The Orbit Community Program follows the [Filecoin Orbit 2021 event](https://orbit.filecoin.io/) where web3 enthusiasts across the world hosted a series of events exploring and celebrating the potential of web3. The goal of the program is to facilitate, fast-track, and inspire the growth of diversified crypto hubs with borderless reach, giving people of all backgrounds equal opportunity to learn about disruptive Web3 technologies and its various applications.

The first step is to build a thriving, engaged community, and to dive into the deep end of the Filecoin ecosystem. Those who join will help strengthen and build the our communities worldwide, amplify the voice of Filecoin, IPFS, and libp2p in the web3 community (both online and offline!), organize local and regional meetups and events, and create content and educational resources for not only the community, but the rest of the world.

It doesnâ€™t matter if you're a developer or a non-technical supporter, new to Filecoin, or a regular contributor, the only _real_ requirement is a true interest in advancing the mission to preserve humanity's most important information through events and content like Orbit!

To become a Cadet, the first tier of our program, please [apply here](https://btktvjuobzm.typeform.com/to/Dv6FWzlr)! As a Cadet, you'll learn more in depth about Filecoin, IPFS, and libp2p, become an active participant in the community and get to know other Orbit Community Members. Members will be rewarded based on a four-tier milestone system that will range from swag kits to exclusive event invitations and engagement opportunities. More details will be shared soon.

If you are a part of an organization that is interested in supporting the Filecoin community, you should [apply](https://btktvjuobzm.typeform.com/to/XgSjcHyz) to become a member of the Spaceship track! The Spaceship community track allows organizations that are interested in helping grow the community through showcasing new use cases for Filecoin, IPFS, Libp2p. In this sector of the program, there will be opportunities to speak at and sponsor conferences at a high level, introduce new collaborators into the ecosystem, and so much more.

With a team of dedicated Orbit Community Members, together we can elevate the borderless potential of Web3 technology across global barriers. If you are passionate about the community and want to help power decentralized applications on Web3, [**apply to become a part of the Crew today**](https://orbitcommunity.filecoin.io/)!
