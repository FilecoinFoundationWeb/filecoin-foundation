### **Developer Preview: Filecoin in MetaMask**

This build of MetaMask is a special developer release that contains early support for Filecoin, based on the upcoming MetaMask Snaps extensibility system. MetaMask is making this special developer build available so that Filecoin developers can start building Web3 sites based on Filecoin.

### **Filecoin and Chainlink Integration**

Weâ€™re excited to announce that [Chainlink](https://chain.link/) â€” the industry leading decentralized oracle solutionâ€”is integrating with [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io/) â€” the worldâ€™s largest open-source, decentralized storage network â€” to enable bidirectional connection between the Filecoin Network and smart contract enabled blockchains such as Ethereum. As a result, smart contract developers will have a full Web 3.0 infrastructure stack including blockchains for on-chain logic and state changes, Chainlink oracles for off-chain communication and computation, and Filecoin for decentralized storage and data solutions.

### **Truffle Suite Launches NFT Development Template with Filecoin Box**

Filecoin Box is now available in Truffle! Devs can get started with Filecoin Box and have everything they need to create a decentralized art gallery. The Filecoin Box is a template to build, deploy, and transact NFTs, using both the Filecoin Ganache and Ethereum Ganache simulators. With the Filecoin Box, Truffle provides a solid foundation for developers to create solutions for NFT storage and continue bridging the Ethereum, IPFS, and Filecoin ecosystems. [Try the Filecoin Box](https://www.trufflesuite.com/boxes/filecoin).

### **The Filecoin Foundation Announces 50,000 FIL Grant to the Internet Archive**

Weâ€™re thrilled to announce that the Filecoin Foundation has committed 50,000 FIL to the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/), one of the largest libraries in the world and a key defender of information and accessibility. The Filecoin Foundationâ€™s contribution to the Internet Archive will advance the mission of both organizations to preserve humanityâ€™s most valuable information and improve access to information online.

### **Decentralized Data Markets with Filehive**

Recently, Filecoin-based data marketplace Filehive launched its beta app for public use. Filehive is built and maintained by OB1, a dapp development studio that has been behind OpenBazaar and Haven. Filehive is an open source marketplace to upload, maintain, buy, and/or grant datasets. The Filehive project came out of the Filecoin Grants Program and is built on top of Filecoin, [Powergate](https://docs.filecoin.io/build/powergate/), and Loom. It leverages the Filecoin network to incentivize the storage and licensing of datasets, which are retrieved from the IPFS network.

### **Livepeer x Filecoin Co-Mining Pilot**

We are excited to announce that [Livepeer](https://livepeer.org/) is launching a co-mining pilot with [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io/) to enable Filecoin miners to become Livepeer video miners while continuing to mine on the Filecoin network by storing transcoded video data.

The co-mining pilot will:

- Identify the requirements for miners interested in co-mining
- Identify the recommended path for miners interested in co-mining

We are excited to run this co-mining pilot as the next step in the evolution of web3 infrastructure. If you are a miner interested in this pilot or simply looking to learn more about the program, read the [blog post](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/livepeer-x-filecoin-co-mining-pilot/).

### **rust-fil-proofs v6.1.0**

CryptoComputeLab has announced proofs release [v6.1.0](https://github.com/filecoin-project/rust-fil-proofs) which contains a number of significant re-factors and performance optimizations. Including the new **gpu2** that accelerates the Pre-commit Phase 2 stage of sealing dramatically. More details can be found in their most recent [blog post](https://research.protocol.ai/blog/2021/cryptocomputelab-announces-proofs-release-6.1.0/).

### **Network v11 Upgrade**

Network v11 upgrade is scheduled on Apr 12th, 22:00 UTC for accepting [FIP-0014,](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0014.md) which will allow miners to extend any v1 sectorsâ€™ lifetime up to 540 days. More details on implementation releases timelines for this upgrade can be found [here](https://github.com/filecoin-project/community/discussions/74#discussioncomment-545945).

### **Thanks for Participating in FIP-0014!**

The Filecoin community has completed its first-ever FILPoll, a new tool for surveying stakeholders on improvement proposals and other initiatives. Thanks to the 200+ storage miners who participated in the poll for [FIP-0014](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0014.md), which considered whether to allow miners to extend v1 proof sectors to a maximum lifetime of 540 days. Miners voted overwhelmingly to allow extending the v1 proof sectorâ€™s lifetime. Now the Filecoin core devs will make a final decision on whether the FIP should be accepted in the network based on the poll result and final security audit.

### **Decrypt Collaborates with Filecoin for its Inaugural Token Season**

The first [Decrypt](https://decrypt.co/) token season is launching in collaboration with Filecoin! Decrypt token users earn the token when they read articles, share them with friends, and interact in other ways with the media platform. The Decrypt token will be airdropped to usersâ€™ mobile wallets and can be redeemed for Web3 assets. One of the core ideas of Decrypt is to [use the Web 3.0 technologies that they cover](https://decrypt.co/53296/decrypt-is-now-on-ipfs-protocol-labs-filecoin). Visit the Decrypt token FAQ to learn more about the Filecoin season, including how to set up your wallet and get started on the Decrypt mobile app.

### **Mint an NFT with IPFS!**

Dive into the details of NFT minting with IPFS and Ethereum with the brand new guide [Mint an NFT with IPFS](https://docs.ipfs.tech/how-to/best-practices-for-nft-data/) on the IPFS docs site. In this tutorial, youâ€™ll get to know Minty, a simple tool that creates IPFS-backed non-fungible tokens on Ethereum. In [this workshop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNukgBtlWeU&feature=youtu.be), Yusef from Protocol Labs shows how (and why!) to store NFT assets and metadata on IPFS and how to link that data to an on-chain token. If the code overview in the video has you wanting more, the [Minty repo](https://github.com/yusefnapora/minty) is waiting for you to clone it and play around!
