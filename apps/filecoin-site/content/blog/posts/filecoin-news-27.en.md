### Decentralized Storage: Estuary, Web3.Storage, and NFT.Storage

Estuary, Web3.Storage, and NFT.Storage are all gateway systems that act as intermediaries to accept data to store onto IPFS, allow for the collection of CIDs, and provide a way for users to create contracts to store their data on the Filecoin chain. Which is best for your needs? [**Find out how each solution is designed for a particular purpose and a particular audience.**](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/decentralized-storage-estuary-web3.storage-and-nft.storage/)

### Using Filecoin with IPFS

Filecoin is a decentralized network that allows for storing data accessible from virtually anywhere. The other side of this equation is IPFS, web3’s file system for handling storage and retrieval of data across the web for developers. IPFS and Filecoin are complementary systems, and the ecosystem has developed tools like Textile and Estuary to help them work together.

### Filecoin Project Gravity, a Sales Referral Program

A limited-time referral fee program has launched and is offering awards for community storage providers who can bring large datasets onto the Filecoin network. Invite your customers and help create the data gravity pull.

### Storage Provider Fall Public Meeting

Last month, the first Storage Provider Public Meeting was held by Filecoin Foundation. From this meeting, Filecoin discussed:

- Top priorities for Storage Provider Working Group, which includes expanding the Filecoin network by onboarding new enterprise customers and building case studies, and also growing staff to support storage providers and clients regarding program managers, solution architects and to guide new storage providers through incubation centers
- Communication preferences for storage providers and community such as Slack (#fil-mining) and [GitHub](https://github.com/filecoin-project/community/tree/master/community-calls "GitHub")

You can watch the presentation on the [Filecoin Foundation Youtube channel.](https://youtu.be/zGUIUVN75gA "Filecoin Foundation Youtube channel")

### NerpaNet Deprecation Announcement

After thoughtful review regarding the usage and ongoing issues with nerpanet, the decision has been made to spin the nerpanet down. Stay tuned for a full doc explaining the decision, but see below for [**highlights**](https://github.com/filecoin-project/community/discussions/74):

- The tools, configs for spawning and maintaining networks were originally designed for mainnet scale, and do not work as effectively at devnet scale.
- The varied demands and needs (test sector sizes, market volume, etc.) can simply not be solved by a single network.

That said, these problems and your community involvement have pointed to a new approach for devnets. Next, the NetOps team at Protocol Labs is building new and easy-to-use tools for spinning up devnets, and will be releasing them along with a runbook to the community for your own use. If you have any requests or ideas, please chime in on [**this discussion**](https://github.com/filecoin-project/community/discussions/303)!

### The Value of Drand

Drand is a distributed randomness beacon supported by Protocol Labs that provides increased security for its users. Drand provides publicly-available randomness for any third-party applications and services to use. Behind drand is the “League of Entropy” (LoE) — an independent consortium committed to providing bias-resistance and publicly verifiable randomness to the larger tech ecosystem.

We asked the League of Entropy members: “What’s the value of drand for you, and why do you support it?” Check out what they said! [**Learn more**](https://drand.love/blog/2021/09/14/the-value-of-drand/) about drand, the LoE, and the vision for verifiable randomness in Web3.
