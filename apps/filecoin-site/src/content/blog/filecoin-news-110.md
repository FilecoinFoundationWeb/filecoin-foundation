## ✨ Highlights ✨

### 🚀 Avalanche x Filecoin Data Bridge Unlocks Cross-Chain Value

Filecoin Foundation and Ava Labs have launched a native cross-chain data bridge between Avalanche C-Chain and Filecoin via the Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM). This powerful integration combines Avalanche’s high-speed execution with Filecoin’s verifiable storage layer — enabling modular, enterprise-grade infrastructure.

Built by FIL-B and FilOz, the prototype allows data generated on Avalanche to be offloaded to Filecoin, with CID-based proofs verifying integrity and access onchain. It’s a builder-friendly solution for scalable, trustless storage that doesn’t compromise performance.

Why it matters:

- Verifiable & composable: Offload data without leaving Avalanche, with cryptographic proof via Filecoin.
- Compliance-grade retention: Store KYC records, logs, and more — without L1 bloat.
- Optimized for cost & scale: Reduce storage costs while unlocking new demand for Filecoin providers.

### 📡 FIL Dev Summit 6 Virtual Kickoff: Recap & Recordings

The FIL Dev Summit 6 (FDS-6) Virtual Kickoff Sessions set the stage for a pivotal year in the Filecoin ecosystem. Hosted by FilOz and Filecoin Foundation, this five-day virtual series offered deep dives into network growth, storage adoption, technical innovation, and community governance—leading into the in-person event in Toronto that occurred on May 12–13.

Highlights across the week included:

- Day 1: Filecoin State of the Union — A look at market shifts, network metrics, Proof of Data Possession, and Filecoin’s role in AI and Web3 infra.
- Day 2: Storage Adoption — Winning strategies for client onboarding, ecosystem coordination, and enterprise-grade readiness.
- Day 3: Onchain Tech Stack — PDP, FWS, stablecoin payments, and composable storage services powering a smart data economy.
- Day 4: Tools & Builders — UX advances, hackathons, and dev enablement initiatives like F3 APIs and FIL Frame.
- Day 5: Value Accrual & Funding — A focus on real usage, token utility, and stable value flows like USDFC and RAMO.
- Day 6: Governance & Community — New voting tools, improved onboarding paths, and calls for broader participation in Filecoin governance.
