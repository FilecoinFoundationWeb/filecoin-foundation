  title: " Filecoin Foundation 2024 Annual Report "
---
## Introduction 

As the Filecoin community looks toward 2025, Filecoin Foundation (FF) hopes to rally the Filecoin ecosystem around [FF’s top-level ecosystem-facing objective](https://fil.org/blog/filecoin-foundation-s-vision-and-strategic-priorities-for-2025): mobilizing the Filecoin community to make Filecoin work seamlessly and to find product-market fit. But first, we want to look back at 2024 and celebrate the achievements of Filecoin Foundation and the broader ecosystem, from network upgrades and infrastructure improvements to data onboarding partnerships, governance initiatives, and more. 

We’re proud to share our progress and grateful to continue supporting the Filecoin ecosystem throughout 2025. 

## What is Filecoin Foundation? 

Filecoin Foundation’s mission is to preserve humanity’s most important information by facilitating the open source governance of the Filecoin network, funding research and development projects related to Filecoin and decentralized technologies, and supporting the growth of the Filecoin ecosystem and community. 

FF’s vision is to create a world in which Filecoin and related decentralized technologies preserve and protect our world’s history, empower users, and embed core civil liberties and human rights — such as free speech and privacy — into the fabric of the world’s technological infrastructure. We want to build a decentralized, efficient, and robust foundation for the future of the Web.

In 2017, the creators of Filecoin envisioned a governance body to serve as a long-term steward for the Filecoin network, modeled after other open source foundations such as the Mozilla and Linux Foundations. The Filecoin ecosystem is fully decentralized, and that means that FF does not lead or dictate the direction of the Filecoin ecosystem. Rather, like other open source governance bodies, FF’s goal is to bring together and empower the Filecoin community, including storage providers, data clients, token holders, developers, and other ecosystem participants. This includes facilitating the Filecoin network’s open source governance process, providing funding to teams building in the ecosystem, hosting events to convene ecosystem participants, and running critical security programs, as well as supporting the Filecoin ecosystem in other ways.

In this report, you’ll read about the ways that Filecoin Foundation supported the Filecoin community in 2024 and learn about FF’s strategic priorities in 2025. FF’s top ecosystem-facing objective in 2025 is to make Filecoin work seamlessly and find product-market fit, but FF cannot dictate what the Filecoin community should do to pursue these objectives. Rather, FF’s strategic priorities in 2025 are about bringing the community together to achieve those goals. This includes driving a process to align the community on the most important actions to make Filecoin work seamlessly and find product-market fit, supporting projects that will help accomplish those goals, and shifting towards playing a larger role in convening the Filecoin ecosystem to get the right people in the room talking about the right thing at the right time.

But before we dive into our plans for 2025, let’s take a look back at the achievements of Filecoin Foundation in 2024.

## Governance: Facilitating Open Source Decision-making 

Governance by the numbers: 

* 3 network upgrades 
* 11 total FIPs accepted in upgrades
* 41 FIP discussions facilitated 

As an open source project, the Filecoin network is governed in a transparent, community-driven way, in line with open source ideals. FF facilitates an open source governance process by hosting open forums and soliciting feedback from the community to advance core protocol upgrades.

In collaboration with the Lotus, Venus, and Forest implementation teams, FF enacted a planned upgrade schedule in 2024 to align with FF’s commitment to transparency and active participation in governance. This year, three major network upgrades were deployed to mainnet: [v22](https://fil.org/blog/announcing-the-filecoin-nv22-dragon-upgrade-a-leap-forward-in-network-efficiency-and-flexibility) (Dragon), [v23](https://fil.org/blog/announcing-the-filecoin-nv23-waffle-upgrade-enhancing-filecoins-efficiency-and-security) (Waffle), and [v24](https://fil.org/blog/announcing-the-filecoin-nv24-tuk-tuk-upgrade-enhancing-filecoin-s-efficiency) (Tuk Tuk). 

In September, the FF Governance team launched [GovHub](https://www.fil.org/governance/govhub) to make participating in the governance of the Filecoin network more accessible. GovHub hosts PowerVote, an onchain voting tool that is still in development, and Fil Poll, an off-chain non-binding polling tool for gathering opinions on early ideas and community proposals. New governance tools tailored for the Filecoin protocol facilitated meaningful community discussions, enabled votes on critical proposals, and kept members informed about the latest network developments.

## Filecoin Plus: Scaling Network Utilization 

Fil+ by the numbers: 

* 66 active allocators
* 864+ PiB of DataCap distributed  
* 3,855 clients served

FF facilitates the Filecoin Plus (Fil+) program, which aims to increase the amount of useful data stored on the Filecoin network. 

Allocators play a key role in the Fil+ program by verifying and onboarding real client data to the Filecoin network. Their primary responsibility is distributing DataCap to clients.

DataCap is a network resource used in deals to incentivize Filecoin storage actors that are facilitating value-additive activities to the network, such as providing hardware capacity, providing data storage, or providing retrieval of stored data. Clients can use DataCap to pay storage providers as part of a storage deal, which increases a storage provider’s probability of earning block rewards. This year, over 860 PiBs of DataCap have been distributed to 66 allocators, serving 984 clients with active deals. 

Clients can request DataCap from allocators, each of whom has their own application process. FF recently added an allocator registry to the [Fil+ web page](https://fil.org/filecoin-plus/allocators) to help data clients connect with prospective allocators. 

FF’s request for new allocator pathways helps the Filecoin community develop and run novel meta-pathways. This program resulted in 86 pathways joining the program in Q1 of 2024, which promotes faster allocation of DataCap to clients. Each pathway receives an individual audit to ensure compliant storage deals between the allocators, storage providers, and clients, contributing to a growing, healthy storage marketplace. 

The Fil+ governance process now includes a full account of the DataCap distributed from allocators to clients, including how organizations request and receive an audit of DataCap distribution. 

## Security: Safeguarding the Filecoin Network 

Security by the numbers:

* 1 week average resolution time for reported bugs 
* < 1 hour initial response time to all security incidents 
* $441,950 in bug bounties awarded for 8 valid reports

FF’s security team works to protect the Filecoin network. In 2024, the team strengthened network security by:

* Coordinating monitoring systems and incident response protocols across projects and teams, enabling decentralized incident response capabilities; 
* Providing security services and best practices for developers; 
* Providing discounted access and introductions to qualified security auditors and security service providers specializing in Filecoin; and 
* Developing new security research tools and testing tooling.

A key milestone was the launch of the [Web3 Security Maturity Model](https://fil.org/security/maturity-model), developed by the FF security team, which helps organizations assess and improve their security as they build decentralized technologies.

#### UXIT: Improving the User Experience and Accessibility Across the Filecoin Ecosystem 

User Experience Improvement Team (UXIT) by the numbers: 

* 17 dogfooding sessions orchestrated 
* 7 organizations supported across the ecosystem
* 2 Filecoin storage provider implementations tested on mainnet

In 2024, FF’s UXIT supported teams and organizations building on the network by identifying usability challenges, addressing performance gaps, and providing actionable feedback on accessibility, search engine optimization (SEO), and development best practices. UXIT completed 17 dogfooding sessions for organizations across the ecosystem, helping improve products and platforms. Additionally, UXIT refreshed crucial network documentation, including Fil+, filecoin.io, and Boost docs, ensuring developers and users have up-to-date, reliable resources.

In addition to this support, FF’s UXIT led the fil.org website relaunch, revamping its design and improving the user experience based on community-driven user interviews. The relaunch enhanced performance, SEO, and introduced new pages and resources requested by the Filecoin community, including [GovHub](https://fil.org/governance/govhub), [Ecosystem Explorer](https://fil.org/ecosystem-explorer), [Fil+ Allocator Registry](https://fil.org/filecoin-plus/allocators), [Orbit Hub](https://fil.org/orbit), [Events Page](https://fil.org/events), [Security Bug Bounty Program](https://fil.org/security/bug-bounty), [Web3 Security Maturity Model](https://fil.org/security/maturity-model), and the [Ecosystem Digest](https://fil.org/digest).

#### Communications and Marketing: Showcasing and Empowering Ecosystem Success
