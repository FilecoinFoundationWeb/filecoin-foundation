## Introduction 

As the Filecoin community looks toward 2025, Filecoin Foundation (FF) hopes to rally the Filecoin ecosystem around [FF’s top-level ecosystem-facing objective](https://fil.org/blog/filecoin-foundation-s-vision-and-strategic-priorities-for-2025): mobilizing the Filecoin community to make Filecoin work seamlessly and to find product-market fit. But first, we want to look back at 2024 and celebrate the achievements of Filecoin Foundation and the broader ecosystem, from network upgrades and infrastructure improvements to data onboarding partnerships, governance initiatives, and more. 

We’re proud to share our progress and grateful to continue supporting the Filecoin ecosystem throughout 2025. 

## What is Filecoin Foundation? 
Filecoin Foundation’s mission is to preserve humanity’s most important information by facilitating the open source governance of the Filecoin network, funding research and development projects related to Filecoin and decentralized technologies, and supporting the growth of the Filecoin ecosystem and community. 


FF’s vision is to create a world in which Filecoin and related decentralized technologies preserve and protect our world’s history, empower users, and embed core civil liberties and human rights — such as free speech and privacy — into the fabric of the world’s technological infrastructure. We want to build a decentralized, efficient, and robust foundation for the future of the Web.

In 2017, the creators of Filecoin envisioned a governance body to serve as a long-term steward for the Filecoin network, modeled after other open source foundations such as the Mozilla and Linux Foundations. The Filecoin ecosystem is fully decentralized, and that means that FF does not lead or dictate the direction of the Filecoin ecosystem. Rather, like other open source governance bodies, FF’s goal is to bring together and empower the Filecoin community, including storage providers, data clients, token holders, developers, and other ecosystem participants. This includes facilitating the Filecoin network’s open source governance process, providing funding to teams building in the ecosystem, hosting events to convene ecosystem participants, and running critical security programs, as well as supporting the Filecoin ecosystem in other ways.

In this report, you’ll read about the ways that Filecoin Foundation supported the Filecoin community in 2024 and learn about FF’s strategic priorities in 2025. FF’s top ecosystem-facing objective in 2025 is to make Filecoin work seamlessly and find product-market fit, but FF cannot dictate what the Filecoin community should do to pursue these objectives. Rather, FF’s strategic priorities in 2025 are about bringing the community together to achieve those goals. This includes driving a process to align the community on the most important actions to make Filecoin work seamlessly and find product-market fit, supporting projects that will help accomplish those goals, and shifting towards playing a larger role in convening the Filecoin ecosystem to get the right people in the room talking about the right thing at the right time.

But before we dive into our plans for 2025, let’s take a look back at the achievements of Filecoin Foundation in 2024.
