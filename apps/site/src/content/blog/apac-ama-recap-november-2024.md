The latest APAC Ask Me Anything (AMA), held on November 21, brought together more than 70 participants, including many Storage Providers (SPs), for a deep dive into the Filecoin ecosystem. The session addressed a series of critical questions spanning governance, market integration, and project development. Below is an overview of the topics discussed.

## Core Values and Market Integration

The AMA opened with a discussion of Filecoin’s core goals and values, emphasizing the network’s evolution as the ecosystem grows. Questions explored global events and trends and the steps needed to strengthen cross-market connectivity. APAC SPs play a key role in bridging the gap between Eastern and Western markets, and the discussion explored strategies for data storage solutions tailored to diverse regions.

The potential integration of AI with Filecoin’s ecosystem was also highlighted as an exciting frontier. Attendees explored scenarios where AI could enhance data storage, retrieval, and ecosystem scalability, offering new opportunities for SPs, developers, and L2s.

## Filecoin Plus Program

A significant portion of the AMA focused on the Filecoin Plus (Fil+) program. Participants discussed current challenges, including allocation inefficiencies and feedback mechanisms. The community’s call for alternative solutions and a more streamlined process was acknowledged, along with  an outline of  ongoing efforts to address these concerns. Attendees were encouraged to continue submitting feedback through[ formal channels](https://join.slack.com/share/enQtODE5OTkxNzMxOTQxMC1lYjk5ZWY4NDNhNDE3NjM2OWMwYjViMTQzZjUwODA3ZDgzMTBhYmFjN2I3MDg5MzYwN2U2ODBlZWEyODYxNGUx) and meetings to drive program enhancements.

## Project Development and Scaling

Projects including Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM) and Interplanetary Consensus (IPC) are key to Filecoin’s scalability and interoperability goals. Attendees expressed keen interest in timelines for deploying applications such as cross-network bridges, perpetual storage solutions, and data DAOs.

The group discussed recent technical milestones and the collaborative efforts shaping its development such as Proof of Data Possession (PDP) for enhanced retrieval services and the need for new guides and documentation for new tools such as [Station](https://docs.filstation.app/).
