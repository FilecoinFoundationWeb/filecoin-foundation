title: Consensus Toronto
description: What is Consensus? Since 2015, Consensus has been more than an
  event–it's the annual gathering of the tribes. It's where the most influential
  voices in blockchain, Web3, and AI come together to drive innovation
  forward.  In 2025, Consensus brings its flagship event to Toronto, where the
  world's first Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs were born. As North America's
  third-largest tech ecosystem and second-largest financial hub, Toronto unites
  global innovation with transformative technology leadership.  Built on
  CoinDesk's foundation of independent, unbiased journalism, Consensus Toronto
  will weave together breakthrough technologies, from digital assets to
  artificial intelligence, fostering the collaborations that define what's
  next.  Don’t miss this moment—join us in Toronto.
