title: Demos and Dogfooding Workshop
description: ​The FF UX Improvement team conducts many ‘dogfooding’ reviews of
  sites, tools, and tutorials across the ecosystem. We see the same issues and
  patterns arising repeatedly - often from insufficient testing with the target
  audience, basic SEO/discoverability errors, and other polish issues that make
  onboarding new users (from devs to SPs) harder than it needs to be. Come for
  the demos, stay to participate in some interactive, live dogfooding of
  ecosystem tooling!
