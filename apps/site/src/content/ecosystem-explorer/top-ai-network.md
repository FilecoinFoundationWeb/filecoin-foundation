TOP AI Network is a decentralized AI Model platform and also the infrastructure for AI Agents, empowering AI model developers to deploy and host their models without the need for costly hardware or complex software. 

TOP AI leverages Filecoin's verifiable storage network to address key challenges in model storage, retrieval, inference, and the reliability of economic models. Currently, TOP AI stores AI model data on Filecoin via Lighthouse. Additionally, TOP AI has completed the development of smart contract, enabling seamless one-click deployment to Filecoin for managing model data, node statuses, and economic models on the blockchain.

In the near future, Filecoin storage providers will be able to participate as computing nodes within the TOP AI network, providing GPU resources and enhancing the network's computational capacity. This will also allow storage providers to earn additional rewards. This step is crucial in establishing a solid storage and computing foundation for AI applications.

Furthermore, TOP AI is working on developing a hot storage solution, offering a more lightweight approach to data storage and retrieval. This solution will be integrated into the Filecoin ecosystem, benefiting a broader community of developers and users.
