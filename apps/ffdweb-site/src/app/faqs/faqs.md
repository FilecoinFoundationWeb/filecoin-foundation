## What is the difference between Filecoin Foundation and Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web?

Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web (FFDW) is the sister nonprofit of Filecoin Foundation. FFDW is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit committed to preserving humanity’s most important information and supporting the development and adoption of decentralized technologies. While Filecoin Foundation stewards the Filecoin network’s future, FFDW promotes the broader development of the decentralized web (DWeb).

## How does FFDW support the development of the decentralized web?

FFDW does this through education on the benefits of decentralized technologies, initiatives that accelerate their adoption, and community building that fosters a network of decentralized web advocates and builders. This includes [collaborations](/projects) with developers, researchers, nonprofit organizations, and others to build robust decentralized infrastructure and introduce and highlight new and impactful use cases for decentralized technologies.

## What types of projects does the FFDW prioritize for funding and support?

At FFDW, we prioritize projects that contribute to the development of decentralized technologies, including infrastructure, tools, and applications. We evaluate projects based on their commitment to decentralized and open-source principles. For example, Internet Archive is leveraging the Filecoin network to make digital culture more resilient; Starling Lab is leveraging decentralized storage to establish trust in digital content; Guardian Project is building decentralized tools for human rights defenders, journalists, and activists; Distributed Press is creating alternatives to centralized publishing platforms; and Spritely is creating ways to authorize and process data without centralized gatekeepers –– see more in the [2024 Report](https://fil.org/blog/filecoin-foundation-2024-annual-report). All these projects are designed to drive the development and adoption of open, decentralized technologies. FFDW works hand-in-hand with funded projects to drive meaningful change.

## What educational resources does the FFDW offer to promote decentralized technologies?

Check out the [Learning Resources](/learning-resources) page! We have a variety of education resources – sourced from FFDW and beyond – including reading, research, webinars, and more, offering a look into decentralized technologies and its applications. These resources start from an introductory level and expand upward for more experienced users and builders. The [DWeb Digest](/digest) is also a deep dive into different perspectives from the decentralized web community.

## How does the FFDW collaborate with other organizations and initiatives in the decentralized web ecosystem?

FFDW actively collaborates with other groups across the decentralized web ecosystem following the principle that collective experience and resources can lead to greater impact! In the past, FFDW has co-funded projects with [Artizen](https://artizen.fund/) and [Unfinished](https://unfinished.com/); co-hosted the Social Impact Summit with [Blockchain Law Center for Social Good at the University of San Francisco](https://www.usfca.edu/law/engaged-learning/center-law-tech-social-good); and participated in [DWeb Camp](https://dwebcamp.org/), among other things.
