  The open-source project ProofMode operates as an almost invisible utility on a
  phone, automatically adding extra digital proof data to all the photos and
  videos captured on a mobile camera. This data can be conveniently shared with
  anyone through a "Share Proof" action. The app aims to enhance media's
  credibility and authenticity by providing cryptographically verifiable digital
  proof.
