  The IPFS docs serve as a source of truth for developing on top of IPFS.
  Information such as popular web3 projects built on IPFS, basic concepts
  surrounding IPFS, subsystems and components that make up IPFS, and more will
  be found here. These basic ideas include peer-to-peer protocols (p2p),
  addressing, routing, transferring, content-addressed data, decentralized file
  systems, hashing, immutability, persistence, subsystems, and IPFS
  implementations.
