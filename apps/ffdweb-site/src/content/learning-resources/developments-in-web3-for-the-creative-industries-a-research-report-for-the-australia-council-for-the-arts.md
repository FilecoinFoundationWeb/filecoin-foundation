  Developments in Web3 for the Creative Industries: A Research Report for the
  Australia Council for the Arts
f_length-3: 92 Pages
f_organization: Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT University)
f_description: >-
  This report identifies how artists, musicians, game designers, and other
  creative practitioners are pushing the established boundaries of the creative
  economy using Web3 tools and platforms. The report steers clear of
  aspirational ‘use cases’ and focuses instead on the industrial transformations
  that have manifested to date, including new ways of manufacturing ownership,
  rewarding and incentivizing fans to sustain creative projects, and the use of
  web3 for organizing and managing collaborative creative endeavors.  Some
  concepts covered in this piece include intellectual property, peer-to-peer
  networks, blockchain, and records management.
