  This Q&A with Guardian Project, an FFDW project partner, explores the
  intersection of decentralized apps (dApps) and social good. It highlights the
  benefits of dApps in terms of data control, security, privacy, and
  preservation. The article discusses common use cases of dApps, including their
  application in the human rights and humanitarian space, and showcases projects
  like F-Droid and ProofMode that leverage decentralized technologies and
  storage for secure app distribution, chain of custody, and verifiable media
  documentation.
