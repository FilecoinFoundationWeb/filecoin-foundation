  Sacred Stacks, a collaborative project by the University of Colorado Boulder's
  Media Economies Design Lab and Center for Media, Religion and Culture,
  explores the potential of decentralized technologies in building stronger
  activist communities and making a social impact. Partnering with seven
  activist communities, they organized a six-month online learning cohort. They
  created an 80-page illustrated zine to reflect on the challenges faced by the
  designers of decentralized tools in serving the communities they aim to
  support, emphasizing the importance of technology in cultivating spiritually
  creative "cyborg communities" and fostering social change.
