description: "The Accelerating Makers project
  (https://acceleratingmakers.publicgoodapphouse.org/) was created to help
  technology builders and nonprofits co-create purpose-built tools for public
  good. Focusing on using DWeb tools, the project empowered nonprofits to take
  ownership of their technology and impact solutions.   This series features
  conversations and resources that explore the benefits, examples, and methods
  of building decentralized solutions that are purpose-built for change makers.
