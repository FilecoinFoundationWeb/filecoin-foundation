  The Accelerating Makers project was created to help
  technology builders and nonprofits co-create purpose-built tools for public
  good. Focusing on using DWeb tools, the project empowered nonprofits to take
  ownership of their technology and impact solutions.

  This series features conversations and resources that explore the benefits,
  examples, and methods of building decentralized solutions that are 
  purpose-built for change makers. Click to view a full archive of data from 
  the project, including copies of all explainers, research, guides, and webinar
