  This video explains some of the issues with the current internet and dives
  into the basic concepts of how the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) aims to
  solve these issues. It explains the data structures employed by the protocol
  and provides a high-level overview of how they work. It also includes a brief
  guide on how to install and use IPFS.

  Some topics covered in this video include distributed hash tables, MerkleDAGs,
  BitTorrent, peer-to-peer protocols, and decentralized file systems.
