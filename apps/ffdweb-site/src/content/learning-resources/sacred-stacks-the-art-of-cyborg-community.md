title: "Sacred Stacks: The Art Of Cyborg Community"
organization: University of Colorado Boulder's Media Economies Design Lab. (MEDLab)
description: >-
  During the second half of 2022, MEDLab led seven communities to explore
  together the needs, ethics, and challenges of emerging decentralized
  technologies. What began as an errant search for practical tools became an
  exploration of ritual, relationship, and poetics. This fully illustrated,
  80-page zine compiles reflections and learnings from the Sacred Stacks cohort.
