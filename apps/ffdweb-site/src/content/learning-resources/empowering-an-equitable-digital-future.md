title: Empowering an Equitable Digital Future
length: ~5 Minutes
organization: Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web (FFDW) & Connect Humanity
description: >-
  Connect Humanity, a social impact fund, partnered with FFDW to survey over
  7,500 civil society organizations across 136 countries to evaluate the state
  of digital equity worldwide. The findings revealed significant barriers to
  internet access, affordability, digital skills, policy implementation, and
  content availability. Connect Humanity and FFDW aim to mobilize resources,
  knowledge, and solutions to bridge the digital divide, ensure equitable access
  to the internet, and promote a more inclusive and equal digital future through
  education and the development of decentralized technologies.
