  Black people in the United States are adopting crypto at high rates relative

  answer why. What are the motivations? What is unique about Black people's
  motivations and participation in crypto? CRADL hopes the Web3 industry,
  leaders at traditional banks, and policymakers use this report as inspiration

  wealth-building opportunities.
