  Black People
f_length-3: 129 Pages
f_organization: Crypto Research and Design Lab (CRADL)
f_description: >-
  Black people in the United States are adopting crypto at high rates relative
  to other groups and to traditional financial tools. This report seeks to
  answer why. What are the motivations? What is unique about Black people's
  motivations and participation in crypto? CRADL hopes the Web3 industry,
  leaders at traditional banks, and policymakers use this report as inspiration
  for meaningful and evidence-based solutions that enable more equitable
  wealth-building opportunities.
