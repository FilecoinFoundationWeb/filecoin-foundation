  Episode 11 of "Exploring the Decentralized Web" explores the transition from
  Web2, which lets you publish your work, to Web3, which lets you monetize that
  work. This episode explores the shift in thinking from scarcity of access to
  scarcity of ownership in art, the rise of NFTs, and how the dweb allows
  individuals to curate, own, and monetize digital creativity, as well as build
  new spaces and leverage existing web2 platforms to create new community
  spaces.
