description: >-
  This article explores how a ‘Decentralised Digital Identity’ concept applies
  to media users or a professional publishing company. It investigates how these
  identities can be used to develop trust and extract new value in the
  publishing and media industries. The work is based on the research undertaken
  by the Cogency project in 2022, which assessed how Web3 can be used to help
  build ongoing trust and develop new revenue streams for publishers and content
  producers.
