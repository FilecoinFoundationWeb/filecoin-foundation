  This article explores how Decentralised Digital Identity applies to media 
  users and publishing companies. It examines how these identities build trust, 
  enhance user agency, and create new value in media and publishing. 

  The research is based on the 2022 Cogency project, which analyzed how Web3 
  can help establish trust and develop new revenue streams for publishers.
