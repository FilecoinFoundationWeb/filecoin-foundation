description: >-
  This YouTube video explores the concept of the decentralized web (DWeb), which
  aims to distribute internet resources across connected devices instead of
  centralized entities. It highlights the Guardian Project's ProofMode app,
  which allows activists and organizations to protect their communications and
  data from intrusion, interception, and monitoring, particularly in documenting
  war crimes. The video emphasizes how decentralized solutions can empower civil
  society, distribute power away from individual control, and better serve
  communities worldwide.
