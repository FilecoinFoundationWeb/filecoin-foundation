  FFDW and OpenArchive Collaborate to Deploy Decentralized Archive for Human
  Rights Data
length: ~5 Minutes
organization: Filecoin Foundation For the Decentralized Web (FFDW) & Open Archive
description: >-
  OpenArchive is a nonprofit dedicated to advancing human rights by empowering
  people to collect, verify, and securely preserve mobile media using
  distributed backends. Through this partnership, OpenArchive will integrate
  decentralized storage solutions, such as IPFS and Filecoin, into their Save
  app. This crucial tool aids individuals in capturing, archiving, and verifying
  images and videos of global events directly from their smartphones, empowering
  at-risk communities and improving censorship mitigation.
