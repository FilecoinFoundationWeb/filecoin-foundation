  Democracy's Library tackles inaccessible government data by creating backups 
  and a repository of verifiable information. Leveraging Web3 and decentralization, 
  it ensures free and permanent access to government records and research.

  By preserving critical information in a repository with verifiable data, the project 
  empowers informed decision-making and supports the future of governance.
