description: >-
  Democracy's Library aims to address the problem of inaccessible government
  data by creating backups and a repository of verifiable information. Their
  goal is to make government records, research, and data freely and permanently
  accessible to all stakeholders, leveraging technologies like Web3 and
  decentralization to transform the structure of knowledge and facilitate better
  collective societal management. By preserving critical information in a
  repository with verifiable information, they strive to empower the future of
  government and enable informed decision-making.
