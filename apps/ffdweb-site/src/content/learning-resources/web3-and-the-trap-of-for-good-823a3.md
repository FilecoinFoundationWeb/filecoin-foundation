  This article explores some issues surrounding social impact initiatives,
  specifically in relation to web3. The authors explain that web3 and
  decentralized finance (DeFi) technologies are too often built under the
  context of "for good" but used as tools of exploitation. Also discussed within
  this article are potential solutions to these issues surrounding
  accountability, governance, community trust, and equitable power structures.
  The authors point out some initiatives that are making an impact and explain
  how to support and contribute to building a better, more transparent internet.
