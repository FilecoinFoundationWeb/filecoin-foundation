  media organizations can install to securely accept documents from anonymous
  sources. The SecureDrop project has been aThe SecureDrop system has been
  around for over 12 years, and recently the Freedom of the Press Foundation
  started designing a new protocol to replace the current server based
  implementation. This blog, and the accompanying code at
  https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-protocol/, goes into detail about
  how the new protocol works to preserve the privacy and anonymity of the
  submitters using cryptography. While the protocol is still in development and
  not ready for production use yet, it's a great example of the kinds of
  tradeoffs and considerations that are needed to protect user anonymity in
  decentralized systems.
