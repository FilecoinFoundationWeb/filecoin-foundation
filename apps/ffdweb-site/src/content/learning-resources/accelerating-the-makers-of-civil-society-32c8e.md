  TechSoup's Accelerating Makers project, supported by FFDW, aims to bridge the
  gap between civil society organizations and decentralized web (DWeb)
  technology. By providing education, resources, and community events, the
  project seeks to introduce civil society decision-makers to DWeb technology
  and enable DWeb Makers to understand the needs and challenges faced by civil
  society organizations, ultimately fostering the development of purpose-built,
  transparency-oriented, equitable solutions for the world's most pressing
  issues.
