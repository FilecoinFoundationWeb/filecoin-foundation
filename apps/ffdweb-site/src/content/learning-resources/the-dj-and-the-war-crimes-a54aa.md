  This Emmy-nominated investigative piece published by Rolling Stone, in
  collaboration with Starling Labs, explores unsolved war crimes in Bosnia. The
  images have authentication certificates, including cryptographic verification
  and hosting on multiple decentralized storage networks. This is one of the
  first deployments of photojournalism on the Dweb, ensuring that we have an
  irrefutable record of these events.
