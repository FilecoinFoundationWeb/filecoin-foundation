  This article discusses how blockchain technology and web3 tools are used to
  preserve and verify evidence of war crimes, as demonstrated by The Starling
  Lab's submission to the International Criminal Court using a
  blockchain-verified chain of custody. This marks the first evidence submitted
  using blockchain technology, ensuring its authenticity, preventing tampering
  or loss, and continuing its digital preservation. This approach can enhance
  transparency through provenance and accountability in legal proceedings
  related to war crimes.
