  FFDW collaborates with MuckRock, a non-profit organization, to leverage the
  Filecoin network, IPFS and the greater decentralized web for preserving public
  documents and enhancing information transparency. MuckRock's DocumentCloud

  ensure the long-term data preservation of these critical resources.
