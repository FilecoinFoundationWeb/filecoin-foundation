f_description: >-
  FFDW collaborates with MuckRock, a non-profit organization, to leverage the
  Filecoin network, IPFS and the greater decentralized web for preserving public
  documents and enhancing information transparency. MuckRock's DocumentCloud
  platform enables journalists and researchers to request, analyze, and share
  government documents via FOIA requests, while decentralized technologies
  ensure the long-term data preservation of these critical resources.
