f_description: >-
  The article discusses the potential of Web3, a decentralized, blockchain-based
  internet ecosystem, to create a fairer and more equitable internet. It
  examines the principles of justice, particularly those of philosopher John
  Rawls, and how they can guide the design of Web3. The article highlights the
  need for Web3 to address wealth inequality, access, and governance issues to
  fulfill its promise of democratizing opportunity and creating a just internet.
  It suggests promoting self-determination and agency, rewarding participation
  over capital, and incorporating initiatives that benefit disadvantaged
  individuals as key steps in achieving justice in Web3.
