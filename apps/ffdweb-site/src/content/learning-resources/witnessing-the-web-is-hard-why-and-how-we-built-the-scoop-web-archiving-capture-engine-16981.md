  This article discusses the development of Scoop, a high-fidelity, open-source,
  browser-based, single-page web archiving capture engine built to address the
  needs of the web archiving community, with a particular focus on specificity,
  accuracy, and security. Scoop employs the "no-alteration principle" to ensure
  captured HTTP exchanges remain unprocessed and authentic. The tool allows
  users to customize their capture policies and how the browser interacts with
  web pages. To ensure decentralization of trust, authenticity, and provenance
  in a decentralized web archiving process, Scoop incorporates support for the
  Web Archive Collection Zipped (WACZ) file format and the WACZ signing and
  verification specification, allowing for a cryptographic seal on the web
  archive fileâ€‹.
