We recently launched [Exploring the Decentralized Web](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0yfvedPY94&list=PL37YlBYJT0nmfqDnbov6lKHUyZvRfQjap&index=1), a 12-part documentary series produced by Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web (FFDW). Featuring leaders and visionaries from top projects across the space, these videos explore the history of decentralized technology and its benefits for users and organizations.

From privacy, identity, and user control, to the latest in NFTs, the metaverse, and DAOs, _Exploring the Decentralized Web_ covers some of the most asked questions and subjects on the evolution of the web. Check out the first four episodes below:

**[Episode 1: "Evolution of the Internet"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptdDPCstMJE)**

Tackling the origin of the internet, the first episode of _Exploring the Decentralized Web_ dives into how the web empowered content creators with new means of self-publishing, democratizing content sharing, and how we transitioned from the initial inception of the internet to today’s centralized, platform-based model. Featuring Brewster Kahle of [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/); digital rights activist Rainey Reitman; Zooko Wilcox-O’Hearn of [Zcash](https://z.cash/), Kristin Smith of the [Blockchain Association](https://theblockchainassociation.org/), and more, this episode walks you through the fractured beginnings of the internet — from Microsoft’s internet alternative “Black Bird,” through the mid-2000’s when the internet and social media began to take off, to today.

**[Episode 2: "Return to Decentralization"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRAlwD5ScrY)**

Exploring the benefits of decentralization, Episode 2 offers examples of how different industries — from finance and accounting, to art and architecture — can harness decentralized technologies. Hear from experts including Brian Behlendorf of the [Open Source Security Foundation](https://openssf.org/); Tara Tan of IDEO CoLab Ventures; artist and software engineer Sarah Friend; Maria Paula Fernandez of jpg.space; and Doug Petkanics of [Livepeer](https://livepeer.org/).

**[Episode 3: "Data and User Control"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tab_vJ6NNGw)**

In today’s Web2 world, corporations control the majority of user data online. In Episode 3 of _Exploring the Decentralized Web_, experts including Sandra Ro of the Global Blockchain Business Council _(original link no longer available)_, Sheila Warren of the [World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/), Mike Masnick of [Techdirt](https://www.techdirt.com/), and Carson Farmer of [Textile](https://www.textile.io/)examine users’ ability to control data and information on the decentralized web, and why this transition is critical for the long-term preservation of information.

**[Episode 4: "Digital Identity"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm8y56KMkIw&t=16s)**

The fourth installment of _Exploring the Decentralized Web_ examines the evolution of users’ digital identities on the web. With a walk-through history, the episode examines the early stages of authentication, from almost nonexistent options for third-party authentication or logins to verify a user’s identity, to the proliferation of single-sign-on options. In Episode 4, Wendy Hanamura of the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/), Danny O’Brien of [FFDW](/), Andrew Hill of [Textile](https://www.textile.io/), and others explain how the decentralized web puts users back in control of their own digital identities. This opens the door to new verification tools and the emergence of a “digital wallet” that contains the entirety of a single user’s digital identity and much more.

_Exploring the Decentralized Web_ is a 12-part documentary series, with new episodes coming out every Wednesday. Make sure to [subscribe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0yfvedPY94&list=PL37YlBYJT0nmfqDnbov6lKHUyZvRfQjap) so you don’t miss any episodes.
