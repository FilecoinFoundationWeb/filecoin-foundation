In an era of eroding cultural memory, the need for innovative approaches to preserving collective history has never been greater. Decentralized technologies offer a transformative path forward, enabling communities to reclaim ownership of their narratives while democratizing access to the past.

To address these challenges, TechSoup has joined forces with Gray Area and Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web (FFDW) to launch the Cultural Memory Lab (CML), an incubator designed to empower cultural organizations, archives, libraries, and museums. By leveraging peer-to-peer networks, distributed storage systems, and blockchain technologies, this initiative aims to reshape how stories are preserved and shared, ensuring that diverse voices remain integral to the historical record.

With funding, mentorship, and technical support, the Cultural Memory Lab invites participants to explore the potential of decentralized tools in safeguarding cultural heritage and expanding access to collective knowledge.

In this Q&A, we sit down with Billy Bicket, Head of Maker Labs at TechSoup, to discuss the goals of the CML, its implications for cultural preservation, and how this initiative is building a more inclusive and equitable future for archiving.

## How does the Cultural Memory Lab address gaps in traditional archival practices, particularly for historically excluded communities?

Throughout history, the stories that shape our collective memory have often been dictated by those in positions of power. However, a growing movement of community-driven and grassroots archiving practices is working to widen the aperture through which we view the past, so that we can better include those who have been excluded. These decentralized, participatory approaches to cultural memory acknowledge the diversity of human experience and empower marginalized communities to take ownership over their own histories.

We believe that decentralized technologies may serve as critical infrastructure for collecting, preserving, and sharing community-generated cultural artifacts outside of centralized control. The Cultural Memory Lab will help projects explore how these tools can equip disparate voices to come together to construct a more pluralistic understanding of the past and help democratize access to history. Marginalized peoples are often at risk of having their stories and cultural memory excluded from traditional narratives, or may even be at risk of having their stories erased. Therefore it’s vital that communities have the knowledge and skills to take control of their cultural memory. The CML enables communities to take ownership of their narratives through ethical and culturally informed approaches, rather than relying on large, centralized institutions. This approach not only addresses resource disparities but also aligns with the values and priorities of these communities, making certain that marginalized voices remain central to the historical record.

At a more logistical level, we know that archivists often lack access to technical  expertise and struggle with prohibitively high storage costs, which leave many community-based organizations unable to fully preserve or share their narratives. For example, a [recent TechSoup](https://techsoup.medium.com/digital-preservation-for-all-building-trust-networks-for-cultural-memory-8d64f2dcdb58) survey found that 53% of cultural heritage organizations lack the technical expertise needed to manage their collections, and 37% cite high storage costs as a significant barrier. By introducing decentralized technologies to these grassroots groups, the Lab aims to provide a more accessible and affordable storage solution.

## What role do decentralized technologies play in transforming cultural memory preservation?

Decentralized technologies like blockchains and peer-to-peer storage networks represent a transformative shift in how we approach cultural memory preservation. By distributing data across a network of nodes rather than storing it in a single location, these technologies ensure that vital records are more resilient to natural disasters, political instability, or other disruptions. This is particularly important for communities whose histories are at risk of erasure or destruction.

One of the most compelling aspects of decentralized technologies is their transparency and immutability, which help build trust in the authenticity of archived materials. However, these features must be carefully balanced with the need for community agency, especially when privacy and the right to modify or delete data are concerned. Overall, these tools create opportunities for equitable, community-led preservation efforts that challenge reliance on any single centralized institution.

## How do you envision decentralized technologies democratizing access to historical records and cultural narratives?

Decentralized technologies have the potential to fundamentally democratize access to historical records and cultural narratives. By eliminating reliance on centralized institutions, a more decentralized web permits communities with limited resources to protect and share their histories on their own terms. For marginalized groups, this means their voices can gain visibility and recognition without being filtered through traditional gatekeepers.

These technologies also enhance resilience, ensuring that histories are maintained even in the face of political suppression or environmental catastrophes. The transparency of decentralized platforms fosters trust in the authenticity of these narratives, enabling them to play a more prominent role in shaping public discourse. In this way, decentralized technologies are not just tools for preservation but also instruments of empowerment and equity.

## What unique opportunities do tools like Filecoin offer for cultural preservation compared to traditional archiving methods?

Filecoin, a decentralized storage network, provides significant advantages over traditional archiving methods. Its distributed infrastructure mitigates the risks associated with centralized systems, such as single points of failure. This decentralized resilience makes it particularly valuable for maintaining archives in regions vulnerable to political instability or natural disasters, as data is distributed across a global network rather than concentrated in a single location.

Filecoin's open market model also fosters competitive pricing, making high-quality, secure storage more accessible to smaller organizations with limited budgets. Moreover, the platform emphasizes community-driven stewardship, empowering local groups to maintain control over their cultural heritage without relying on large, external corporations. This approach aligns with values such as equity, autonomy, and cultural preservation, which are central to the mission of organizations like the Cultural Memory Lab.

## What are some of the key milestones or outcomes you hope participants achieve during the four-month incubator?

The Cultural Memory Lab emphasizes learning and exploration. Toward that end, one of the program’s major milestones is completing Gray Area’s DWeb for Creators course, an 8-week intensive that helps activists, archivists, and other culture workers apply the principles of decentralized technologies to their practice. This course, combined with the technical workshops, will support teams’ efforts to prototype decentralized solutions for their digital archiving projects. The Cultural Memory Lab program emphasizes process over final output, so the presentation of the projects can come in the form of progress reports, interactive prototypes, or learnings from teams’ experiments with the decentralized web.

At the CML, we aim for participants to achieve several significant milestones. These include:

1. Prototyping decentralized solutions for their digital archiving projects 
2. Developing a tailored digital preservation plan: Participants will design strategies that leverage decentralized storage solutions to safeguard their cultural assets.
3. Integrating decentralized storage into workflows: By the end of the program, participants will have hands-on experience implementing platforms like Filecoin to store and share their archives securely.
4. Empowering community ownership: Archives will understand how to set up and manage community-driven cultural memory.
5. Sharing knowledge: Participants will contribute insights and best practices that can inform and inspire other cultural heritage organizations globally. A showcase event will enable participants to share their work with peer organizations.

## What insights do you hope the broader field of digital archiving and cultural memory will gain from the work of the Cultural Memory Lab?

The Cultural Memory Lab aims to provide the broader field of digital archiving with actionable insights into the potential of decentralized technologies.

First, the CML’s work will demonstrate how community-controlled infrastructure can enhance resilience and sovereignty over cultural assets. Second, our in-person DWeb Node workshops will highlight the importance of integrating regional leaders and support networks among cultural heritage organizations to foster collaboration and provide technical assistance.

Additionally, the Lab’s emphasis on responsible and ethical technology implementation will offer a model for integrating new technologies in ways that center community agency and minimize harm. By addressing the unique needs of historically marginalized communities, the Lab hopes to inspire more inclusive and culturally informed practices in digital archiving and cultural preservation. Ultimately, these insights aim to advance the field by creating tools and systems that prioritize agency, equity, accessibility, and long-term sustainability.

We see this work as part of a broader movement to reimagine technology infrastructure for civil society. We invite you to join us in exploring key questions like these:

* What governance models best support community control?
* What regional support networks and collaborative models will best serve small cultural heritage organizations exploring DWeb tools?
* How do we ensure our technical support and microgrants create lasting value for community-based archives?

This is complex work that requires ongoing dialogue between communities, Makers, funders, and cultural heritage practitioners. We’re grateful to be learning alongside so many dedicated partners as we work toward more equitable and sustainable approaches to cultural preservation.
