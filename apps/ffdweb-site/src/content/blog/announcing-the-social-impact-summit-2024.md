“We have to take a holistic approach to address the accelerative transformation of our digital futures, with people at the heart of the agenda, focusing on restoring and protecting humanity’s personhood and integrity, strengthening community resilience in the face of digital harms, and closing the knowledge gap between those who hold decision-making power and those who are working tirelessly to advance responsible innovation. The Social Impact Summit is an opportunity for the Blockchain Law for Social Good Center to provide a platform for multistakeholders to engage in fruitful knowledge exchange, spark bold ideas and solutions and spur community-driven global impact,” said Evin Cheikosman, Director, Blockchain Law for Social Good Center.

The 2024 Social Impact Summit will harness the blockchain industry’s momentum to explore how technology can be a catalyst for societal change, highlighting real-world examples of how technology is helping build stronger, more resilient communities, economies, and societies.
