Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web (FFDW) is the sister nonprofit of Filecoin Foundation. FFDW’s mission is to serve the public good by supporting the entire decentralized web (DWeb) ecosystem. In the pursuit of preserving humanity's most important information, FFDW envisages a crucial role for decentralized storage systems –– such as those built by the many participants in the Filecoin ecosystem. 

While Filecoin Foundation stewards the Filecoin network’s future, FFDW supports the broader development of decentralized technology. This includes supporting institutions that can provide for long-term collection, digitization, and distribution of all forms of knowledge, as well as projects working on open-source software and protocols that can protect our cultural and scientific heritage from fragile single points of failure and centralized institutions.

This means supporting endeavors that preserve data and distribute it: safekeeping data that is most vulnerable to erasure and supplying the tools for archivists and GLAM institutions (galleries, libraries, archives, and museums) to use decentralized systems and take advantage of the benefits as easily as they can existing centralized tools. 

In this report, you’ll see the progress achieved by FFDW and our exceptional roster of project partners in creating profound and wide-reaching impact in a moment of growing interest and appreciation for decentralized values.
