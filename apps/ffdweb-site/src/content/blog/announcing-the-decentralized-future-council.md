_New Organization Dedicated to Untangling Decentralized Technologies for Policymakers_

The Decentralized Future Council (DFC) is a new organization dedicated to advocacy and education for the emerging decentralized web and related technologies. A project by both the [Internet Education Foundation](https://www.neted.org/) and [Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web](/) (FFDW), the Council will raise awareness for the larger ecosystem of new technologies, from blockchain to cryptocurrency. Additionally, the Council will work to educate policymakers around new and upcoming challenges that correspond with these emerging technologies including privacy, security, democracy, online trust and safety, and more.

"We want to help lawmakers understand the enormous potential that the decentralized web has to offer," said Tim Lordan, advisor to the DFC. "Decentralized web technologies will transform the internet as we know it. And we want to help distill myths and pave the way for these technologies to make an impact."

The Council is building a presence in Washington, DC, to connect with and educate key policymakers on decentralized technologies. It will be actively involved in hosting education initiatives to highlight the potential of these emerging technologies, including educational briefings, podcasts, social events, policy conferences, and more. The Council will engage leading decentralized web scholars, influencers, public interest organizations, and regulators to address key topics relative to establishing a new framework and infrastructure for the future of the decentralized web.

"We are thrilled to support the Decentralized Future Council, and its work to advocate for decentralized web technology," said Marta Belcher, president and chair of the Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web. "Education is a core tenant of FFDW's mission, and DFC will be critical in educating policymakers on what a decentralized future can look like."

In the coming months, the Council will be building out platforms for policy engagement on decentralized web issues. Upcoming events include:

- [Trust and Safety and the Decentralized Web](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/trust-and-safety-and-the-decentralized-web-tickets-272256896707) (March 24, 2022): A virtual seminar exploring potential trust and safety implications of Web3 technologies and how to get ahead of the curve.
- The Decentralized Web Policy Summit (April 2022): An in-person event in Washington, DC featuring Web3 thought leaders set to discuss the decentralized web's potential in policy areas.
- 1st Annual Decentralized Web Policy Forum (August 2022): An invite-only gathering in Jackson Hole bringing together key policymakers, dweb stakeholders, and members of the press. The Summit will tackle broader policy issues related to the emerging decentralized web.
