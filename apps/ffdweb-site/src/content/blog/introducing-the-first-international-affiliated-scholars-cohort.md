*New Program Hosted by the Blockchain Law for Social Good Center at the University of San Francisco School of Law* 

In the landscape of modern technology, few innovations have sparked as much interest as blockchain and related technologies. Blockchains can reshape entire industries and transform how people use the internet. Although there are countless use cases, there is still limited research into the legal and policy implications of blockchain technology and how it will impact the world around us – from digital identity and personhood to cybersecurity and sustainability. The Blockchain Law for Social Good Center is on a mission to equip the legal, government, and policy communities with the knowledge and tools they need to understand the challenges and opportunities of this emerging technology.    

The International Affiliated Scholars (IAS) program is a part of the Center’s educational focus. The IAS program, supported by Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web (FFDW), will bring together and empower blockchain scholars worldwide to explore the nexus of blockchain law and social good. 

On Tuesday, September 26 at 8:30 am PT, the Center is hosting a Virtual Kickoff *(original link no longer available)* to welcome the new cohort and introduce the topics they’ll be exploring as part of the program. Each cohort member is poised to challenge norms, fuel cross-disciplinary collaboration, and explore how technology impacts our daily lives.
