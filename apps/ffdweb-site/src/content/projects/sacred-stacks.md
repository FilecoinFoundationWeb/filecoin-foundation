description: Sacred Stacks is an initiative within the Media Design Lab at the
  University of Colorado. The project explores how decentralized technologies
  may benefit communities centered around deep commitments, like spiritual
  experimentation, collective study, and social transformation. In this
  collaboration, we explore how decentralized tools and selfgovernance practices
  can make these communities even stronger.
