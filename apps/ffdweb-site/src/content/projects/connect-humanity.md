f_blurb: As we pursue our goal of supporting an internet for everyone, it is
  imperative that we best understand how people around the world use the
  internet. To help us with this understanding, Connect Humanity is implementing
  a series of global surveys through a network of thousands of community-focused
  organizations to pull down data on how their communities rely on, benefit
  from, and want to see in the internet. Connect Humanity recently completed a
  widespread survey and scenario process to inform and deliver a report (and
  subsequent workshops) to summarize civil society gaps and needs toward the
  advancement of digital equity.
