f_blurb: Spritely’s mission is to put people directly in control of their online
  identities and relationships. This award helps further the organization’s
  efforts on projects ranging from decentralized identity to decentralized
  social networks to encrypted and portable storage. This technology is open,
  free, and built to enable a gatekeeper-free path, where users and social
  content are not tied to a specific server or company.
