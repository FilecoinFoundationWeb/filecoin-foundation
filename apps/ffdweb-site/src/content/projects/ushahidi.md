  "Ushahidi's Election Data Resilience Initiative aims to make election
  data accessible and verifiable. This project plans to create a permanent
  repository of election data using Filecoin, a decentralized storage network.
  This will make the data more accessible to researchers, policymakers, and the
  public and help ensure it cannot be altered. "
