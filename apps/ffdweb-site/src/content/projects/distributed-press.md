f_blurb: Distributed Press is an initiative to build an open source, no-code
  publishing tool for the World Wide Web and DWeb to empower authors and amplify
  free expression worldwide. We are collaborating with Hypha Worker Cooperative
  and Sutty worker co-operative to build Distributed Press. The tool will take
  DWeb-native publications mainstream as a reliable end-to-end DWeb publishing
  platform and enable all creators to publish to the DWeb. New technical
  features of Distributed Press will be showcased in COMPOST, a magazine
  centering stories about the digital commons.
