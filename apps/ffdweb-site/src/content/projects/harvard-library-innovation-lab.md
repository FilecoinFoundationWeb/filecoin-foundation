description: As a specialized lab within the Harvard Law Library, LIL explores
  new ways for libraries to share knowledge through technology; the
  Democratizing Open Knowledge program is focused on enhancing discovery and
  engagement with open data and exploring new ways to preserve digital
  information. FFDWâ€™s support enables the Library to explore how decentralized
  and open web technologies can help advance discovery and preservation of human
  knowledge, including using decentralized storage technologies like Filecoin
  and the Interplanetary File System (IPFS).
