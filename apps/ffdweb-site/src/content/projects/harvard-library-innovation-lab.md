f_blurb: As a specialized lab within the Harvard Law Library, LIL explores new
  ways for libraries to share knowledge through technology; the Democratizing
  Open Knowledge program is focused on enhancing discovery and engagement with
  open data and exploring new ways to preserve digital information. FFDWâ€™s
  support enables the Library to explore how decentralized and open web
  technologies can help advance discovery and preservation of human knowledge,
  including using decentralized storage technologies like Filecoin and the
  Interplanetary File System (IPFS).
