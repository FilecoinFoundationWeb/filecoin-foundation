  The three-year FFDW award supports infrastructure, user experience, and
  security enhancements for tools used by journalists around the globe. It’s
  also being used to explore a zero-trust architecture for SecureDrop, an
  open-source news and information submission system used by newsrooms worldwide
  for secure document exchange and communication between journalists and
  anonymous sources. Overall, the award helps to further the FPF’s efforts to
  preserve historically critical information, such as its comprehensive database
  of press freedom violations in the United States and government data that
  belongs in the public sphere.
