description: The Web Foundation advanced Sir Tim Berners-Lee's original vision
  for an open web that is safe, trusted, and empowering for all of its users.
  Decades after his invention, over 5 billion people are on the web and it faces
  constant and evolving threats to his vision. FFDW supported the Web Index,
  which provided unique data and insights to help better understand what is
  happening in the online lives of users, and in what areas a course correction
  is needed.
