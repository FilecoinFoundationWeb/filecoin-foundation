  the Internet Education Foundation and FFDW. DFC raised awareness for the
  larger ecosystem of new technologies, from blockchain to decentralized storage
  and DNS, and worked to educate policymakers about new and upcoming challenges
  that correspond with these emerging technologies, including privacy, security,
  democracy, online trust and safety, and more.
