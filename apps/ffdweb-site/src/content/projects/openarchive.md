f_blurb: OpenArchive is a nonprofit dedicated to advancing human rights by
  empowering people to collect, verify, and securely preserve mobile media using
  distributed backends. Through the collaboration with FFDW, OpenArchive is
  exploring decentralized backends for the Save app. This will enable people on
  the ground capturing images and footage of world events to leverage IPFS and
  Filecoin and other decentralized storage options via their mobile device.
