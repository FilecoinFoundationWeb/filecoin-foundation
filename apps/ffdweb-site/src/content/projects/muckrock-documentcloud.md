description: FFDW and MuckRock are teaming up to integrate decentralized storage
  technology for DocumentCloud, a platform that currently hosts over 8 million
  verified documents. This collaboration expanded MuckRockâ€™s leading
  accountability and transparency tools to a much wider range of use cases.
  DocumentCloud has become a bridge for newsrooms, non-profits, researchers, and
  more to move key public interest documents to Filecoin, a decentralized
  storage network, and support preservation, publication, and analysis efforts.
