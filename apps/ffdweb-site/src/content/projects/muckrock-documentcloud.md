f_blurb: FFDW and MuckRock are teaming up to integrate decentralized storage
  technology for DocumentCloud, a platform that currently hosts over 8 million
  verified documents. This collaboration will expand MuckRockâ€™s leading
  accountability and transparency tools to a much wider range of use cases. It
  will allow DocumentCloud to become a bridge for newsrooms, non-profits,
  researchers, and more to move key public interest documents to Filecoin, a
  decentralized storage network, and support preservation, publication, and
  analysis efforts
