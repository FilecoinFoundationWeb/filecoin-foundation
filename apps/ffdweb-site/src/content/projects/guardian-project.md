f_blurb: This project between FFDW and the Guardian Project is aimed at breaking
  down the notion that centralization is a necessary requirement for providing
  meaningful security and authentication for content veracity and distribution.
  It incorporates decentralized storage and communication technology into
  ProofMode, a system that enables authentication and verification of multimedia
  content captured on smartphones and is leveraged by human rights organizations
  across the globe. This project also accelerates the adoption of decentralized
  storage technology for F-Droid, the leading free and open-source app
  publishing platform.
