  "The Internet Archive runs dozens of projects, including: the Wayback
  Machine, a repository of 475 billion web pages; OpenLibrary.org, a free,
  digital lending library of over 4.6 million eBooks; Software Collections,
  designed to preserve and provide access to rare or difficult to find software
  titles that enable gamers to play them through emulation; and Community Webs,
  which trains, supports, and provides web archiving resources to public
  librarians at institutions across the U.S. and Canada. The Internet Archive
  also hosts the Filecoin Archives, a community-led project to curate,
  disseminate and preserve important open access to information often at risk of
  being lost. Filecoin Foundation's contribution to the Internet Archive
  advances the mission of both organizations to preserve humanity's most
  valuable information and improve access to information online."
