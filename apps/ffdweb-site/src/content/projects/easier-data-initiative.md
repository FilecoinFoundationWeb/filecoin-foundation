f_blurb: In partnership with researchers from the University of Marylandâ€™s
  Department of Geographical Sciences, the Initiative ensures that large
  geospatial datasets are accessible to research organizations and the general
  public. This collaboration with FFDW will help the Initiative develop the
  capacity and infrastructure for uploading, analyzing, and extracting large
  quantities of data using decentralized storage technologies, including
  Filecoin and IPFS.
