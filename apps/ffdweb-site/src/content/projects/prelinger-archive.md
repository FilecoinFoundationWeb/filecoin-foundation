  The Prelinger Archives is using its award from FFDW to digitize a vast
  collection of archival 8mm, 16mm, and 35mm film footage to further its mission
  to make rare and one-of-a-kind films accessible to the general public. This
  project will also support uploading the data onto a decentralized repository
  in order to increase the resilience and longevity of digital preservation.
