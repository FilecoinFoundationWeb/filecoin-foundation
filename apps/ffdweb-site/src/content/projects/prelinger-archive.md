description: The Prelinger Archives is using its award from FFDW to digitize a
  vast collection of archival 8mm, 16mm, and 35mm film footage to further its
  mission to make rare and one-of-a-kind films accessible to the general public.
  The project also supports the uploading of the data onto a decentralized
  repository in order to increase the resilience and longevity of digital
  preservation.
