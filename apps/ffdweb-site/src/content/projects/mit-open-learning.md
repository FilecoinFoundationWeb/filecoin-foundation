  MIT Open Learning at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is transforming
  teaching and learning through the innovative use of digital technologies. MIT
  Open Learning makes educational resources and courses available to learners
  around the globe.


  The Open Learning team is exploring how decentralized technology can bolster its programs, including MIT OpenCourseWare. By experimenting with IPFS and the Filecoin network to store and distribute OpenCourseWare content, this collaboration aims to enable broader access to OpenCourseWare's 2,500+ MIT courses, reaching more than 500 million people worldwide since the program launched.
