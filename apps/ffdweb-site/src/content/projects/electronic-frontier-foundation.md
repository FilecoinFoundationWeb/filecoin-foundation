blurb: "EFF is an essential champion of user privacy, free expression, and
  innovation through impact litigation, policy analysis, grassroots activism,
  and technology development, and has been since their founding in 1990. Their
  staff of nearly 100—including lawyers, activists, and technologists–works to
  ensure that our rights and freedoms are enhanced and protected as our reliance
  on technology grows worldwide. EFF works on issues at the local, state,
  federal, and international levels on six main issue areas: free speech,
  digital privacy, creativity and innovation, transparency, international, and
  security."
