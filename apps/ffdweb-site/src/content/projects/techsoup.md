  Working with a network of partners, TechSoup supports change makers worldwide
  as they use digital solutions to achieve their own goals. With FFDWâ€™s award,
  TechSoup kicked off a new project, Accelerating Makers, dedicated to
  supporting decentralized technologies in the civil society tech stack.
  Accelerating Makers will support a breed of early-stage creators so they can
  understand and adopt decentralized technologies in their work and lives.
