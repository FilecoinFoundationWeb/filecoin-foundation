f_blurb: Food for Crisis, a joint initiative between Global Blockchain Business
  Council (GBBC) Giving and World Food Programme (WFP) Innovation Accelerator,
  ensures efficiency and transparency of humanitarian aid through blockchain
  technology. This project aims to trace funds from donation to beneficiary,
  relying on blockchain and decentralized storage (Filecoin IPFS system). This
  will provide real-time visibility into fund flows, while protecting privacy,
  and providing agency for donors to better view the impact of their
  contributions. A differentiating factor is the ability to trace both crypto
  and non-crypto funds, which would be represented as digital twins on a
  blockchain. Food for Crisis will integrate with local payment systems (e.g.,
  traditional bank transfers, e-vouchers, and mobile money).
