description: Food for Crisis, a joint initiative between Global Blockchain
  Business Council (GBBC) Giving and World Food Programme (WFP) Innovation
  Accelerator, ensures efficiency and transparency of humanitarian aid through
  blockchain technology. This project aims to trace funds from donation to
  beneficiary, relying on blockchain and decentralized storage (the
  Filecoin/IPFS system). This will provide real-time visibility into fund flows,
  while protecting privacy, and providing agency for donors to better view the
  impact of their contributions. A differentiating factor is the ability to
  trace both crypto and non-crypto funds, which would be represented as digital
  twins on a blockchain. Food for Crisis will integrate with local payment
  systems (e.g., traditional bank transfers, e-vouchers, and mobile money).
