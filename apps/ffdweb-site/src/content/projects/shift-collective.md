f_blurb: Shift Collective is a nonprofit that helps cultural memory
  organizations better engage, collaborate with, and reflect their local
  communities. FFDWâ€™s support enables SHIFT to map the decentralized storage
  needs of memory organizations, such as galleries, libraries, archives and
  museums, and build a pilot storage network, with Historypin.org as a basis, to
  be tested in collaboration with institutional and community archives partners.
  The goal is to design an early prototype for community-centered,
  non-extractive, affordable, and accessible long-term, decentralized storage.
