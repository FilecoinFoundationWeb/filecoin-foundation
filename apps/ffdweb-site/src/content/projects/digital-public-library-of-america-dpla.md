description: Together, DPLA's partners hold 50 million items that represent our
  nation’s cultural heritage—photographs, videos, books, news footage, oral
  histories, letters, artwork, government documents, and much more. Storing this
  information on Filecoin would increase public access while providing an extra
  layer of protection against loss of access due to changes in institutional
  budgets, priorities, or technology. Bridging between DPLA's partners and
  emerging technologies is a familiar role for DPLA. To bridge DPLA partners to
  Filecoin, this collaboration will yield a pilot project that preserves a
  portion of one of DPLA partners’ collections on Filecoin for a trial period
  and share the results with their community.
