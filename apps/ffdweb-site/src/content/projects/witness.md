  WITNESS is an international nonprofit organization that helps people
  use video and technology to protect and defend human rights. With the support
  of FFDW, WITNESS will explore how the decentralized web can support the work
  of activists, civic journalists, and smartphone witnesses who go to great
  lengths to capture human rights accounts, building upon a 30-year history
  bridging the needs of communities with the global technology systems in which
  they live and work.
