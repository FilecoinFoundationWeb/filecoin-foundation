order: 4

#### 1. Access Control Mechanisms

##### 1.1 User Authentication and Authorization

- You have a method of tracking users or identities within your org or project by alias or identity
- You have a method of integrating authentication mechanisms into your technical and business or project workflows
- Level 1: Is there a basic system for user authentication, possibly using common credentials or simple key-based access for participants?
- Level 2: Are there more advanced, multi-factor authentication systems in place, catering to the decentralized and pseudonymous nature of users, while ensuring secure access control?
- Level 3: Is there a sophisticated, dynamic authentication and authorization system that adapts to user roles and contexts, integrating decentralized identity solutions where applicable?

##### 1.2 Privilege Management

- You have identified roles for each person in the project or org
- There is some separation of roles / permissions for identities
- Level 1: Are basic privileges assigned based on user roles, even if these roles are not tied to real-world identities?
- Level 2: Is there an advanced system for managing privileges that reflects the dynamic and distributed nature of the team, with periodic reviews?
- Level 3: Are privilege management processes highly evolved, with automated role-based access control and continuous monitoring for anomalous access patterns?

#### 2. Identity Verification and Management

##### 2.1 Identity Proofing and Verification

- You can verify authenticity of identities within your workflows
- Level 1: Is there a basic form of identity proofing, possibly relying on community reputation or existing trust networks?
- Level 2: Are there more structured identity verification processes that balance the need for some form of reliable identification with the respect for pseudonymity?
- Level 3: Is there a comprehensive identity verification system that effectively manages risk while accommodating the decentralized, pseudonymous nature of the community?

##### 2.2 Identity Lifecycle Management

- There is a method for provisioning and deprovisioning identities or accounts
- Level 1: Is there an initial process for managing the lifecycle of identities (creation, maintenance, deletion) in a decentralized environment?
- Level 2: Are there advanced processes in place for systematically managing the identity lifecycle, including periodic verification and adjustment of access rights?
- Level 3: Is the identity lifecycle management process fully integrated, featuring continuous updating and refinement, and leveraging decentralized technologies where appropriate?
