### 1. Decentralized Application Security

#### 2.1 Security Best Practices for DApps

- Security is considered formally for the contracts being developed for the application
- Security is considered for DApp front ends if they exist
- Some element of security function is applied to DApps
- Level 1: Are there initial best practices identified and implemented for the security of Decentralized Applications (DApps)?
- Level 2: Are these best practices more comprehensive, regularly updated, and aligned with emerging security trends in the decentralized space?
- Level 3: Is there an advanced set of best practices, widely recognized and adhered to, with proactive measures to anticipate and address future security challenges in DApp development?

#### 2.2 Smart Contract Security

- Contracts are reviewed for security in some way
- Audits have been conducted or are planned for the contracts associated with the project or team
- There is internal knowledge of smart contract security and best practices
- Level 1: Is basic security in place for smart contracts, such as using known patterns and simple audits?
- Level 2: Are smart contract security measures more rigorous, including thorough audits, formal verification, and vulnerability scanning?
- Level 3: Is there a sophisticated, continuous security process for smart contracts, employing cutting-edge tools and practices, and integrating community feedback for ongoing improvement?

### 3. Third-party Code Review

#### 3.1 Review Procedures

- Code reviews are conducted for third party components
- There is an inventory of third party components available
- Level 1: Are there basic procedures in place for the review of third-party code, focusing on major known vulnerabilities?
- Level 2: Are review procedures more comprehensive, regularly updated, and include systematic checks for a broader range of security issues?
- Level 3: Is there a highly advanced code review process, integrating automated tools, continuous integration checks, and peer review systems?

#### 3.2 Community-Based Reviews

- There is engagement with the community to peer review third party code
- There are published issues or vulnerabilities for the third party
- Level 1: Is there an initial engagement with the community for code review on an ad-hoc basis?
- Level 2: Are community-based reviews more structured and regularly solicited, with clear guidelines and incentives for community participation such as a bug bounty program?
- Level 3: Is there an established, robust community review ecosystem, with ongoing interaction, collaboration, and recognition systems to encourage active community involvement?

### 4. Security in Project Stewardship

#### 4.1 Advisory Standards

- Standards exist for extended ecosystem of the project
- There have been submissions from the project or organization to the greater ecosystem
- There is some engagement with the greater community
- Level 1: Are basic advisory standards in place for guiding projects on security matters?
- Level 2: Are these standards more detailed, tailored to various types of projects, and regularly reviewed for relevance and effectiveness?
- Level 3: Are advisory practices highly advanced, regarded as industry standards, and include a proactive approach to advising on emerging security threats and technologies?

#### 4.2 Feedback and Improvement Loop

- The project or organization is accepting of feedback from external stakeholders
- Feedback has been or is planned for incorporation into the product
- Level 1: Is there a basic process for receiving and incorporating feedback into security advisory practices?
- Level 2: Is feedback systematically solicited and analyzed, with structured mechanisms for integrating insights into continuous improvement of advisory services?
- Level 3: Is there a mature, dynamic feedback and improvement system, deeply integrated into the stewardship approach, fostering ongoing adaptation and enhancement of security advisory services?
