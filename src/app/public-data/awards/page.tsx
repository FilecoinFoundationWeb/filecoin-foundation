          The Public Data Awards is a location-specific $50,000 funding pool for
          non-profits and civic technology groups.
        </p>
        <p>
          It will disperse awards up to $10,000 USD to support projects that
          either leverage datasets or advance learning around datasets stored on
          decentralized technology. Each iteration of the award has its own
          $50,000 pool. The Public Data Awards are specific to locations
          centered around governments with which Filecoin Foundation is
          partnering.
        </p>
        <p>
          The award is intended to fund anything from a project analyzing air
          quality data recently uploaded to Filecoin to an educational seminar
          about how to access and use your city’s data stored on Filecoin or
          IPFS. To maximize public learning, all awards should result in at
          least one public output or outcome (e.g., a blog, event, data tool).
        </p>
        <p>
          Note: This Awards program is contingent on the support and involvement
          of local government officials.

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <article>
          <h3>Who is eligible for this award?</h3>
          <p>
            Only individuals and non-profit or civic technology organizations
            based in or working directly in the featured city or jurisdiction
            are eligible at this time.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article>
          <h3>What strings are attached to this funding?</h3>
          <p>
            None. We simply ask you to write up a short (one page) report within
            30 days of your project concluding. The reports should help the
            public understand how you spent the money, what you learned, and who
            benefited from the project.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article>
          <h3>What are the sizes of these Awards?</h3>
          <p>
            While each location’s overall pool of funding is $50,000, the range
            for individual awards is up to $10,000 USD. An individual award will
            not exceed $10,000, even if your project costs more.

        <article>
          <h3>How can I spend this money?</h3>
          <p>
            Tell us in the application – it could be anything from food & drink
            for an in-person tutorial on how to access and use decentralized
            public data, to an hourly rate covering your team’s programming or
            engineering work to build a data egress or ingress pipeline. We
            expect the funds to cover as much of the costs as possible of your
            planned initiative, including paying for staff time.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article>
          <h3>Is there a date by which I need to spend the money?</h3>
          <p>
            This is a rapid-fire program designed to quickly spur new
            innovations and ideas in the decentralized technology space. To help
            with that goal, we hope that you will spend the money within 90 days
            of receipt.
