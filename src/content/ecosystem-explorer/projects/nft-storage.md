NFT.Storage is a long-term storage service designed for off-chain NFT data (such as metadata, images, and other assets) for content up to 31GiB in size per individual upload. Filecoin provides long-term storage for this data, ensuring that even if NFT.Storage is attacked or taken down, the NFT data persists.
