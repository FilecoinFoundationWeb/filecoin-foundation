Algovera is a collaboration platform for large language model applications, allowing users to build AI apps easily, quickly, and with no-code. Algovera built an AI hub as a tool for data scientists to easily build on top of IPFS and Ocean Protocol. Algovera also developed a framework for the creation of major Data Science community support tools like python libraries for decentralized storage, an integration of python's interface with data science frameworks, like HuggingFace, Activeloop, and JupyterLab.
