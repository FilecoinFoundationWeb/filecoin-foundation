STFIL Protocol, launched on the Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM) mainnet in April 2023, stands as the first and one of the largest liquidity staking protocols in the Filecoin ecosystem. We empower $FIL token holders with the ability to generate stable yields while providing storage providers with collateralized loans to facilitate leveraged mining.

Our unique value proposition lies in our innovative staking model, which incorporates a flexible staking pool. This approach ensures that the STFIL Protocol is expandable and adapts seamlessly to the fast-paced evolution of the decentralized storage ecosystem.
