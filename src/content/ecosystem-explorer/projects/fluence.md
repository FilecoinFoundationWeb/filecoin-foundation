Fluence is a decentralized serverless computing platform. Using Fluence, developers can build, host, and deploy peer-to-peer applications to a network of compute providers, where providers can range from professional data centers to home computers. Fluence facilitates building decentralized applications like P2P apps, decentralized protocols, community-run applications, computations on decentralized data, cloud-native computing, and blockchain infrastructure.
