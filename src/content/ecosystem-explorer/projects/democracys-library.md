The Internet Archive’s Democracy’s Library project is creating a free, open collection of government data to ensure that government research and publications from around the world remain permanently accessible to the public. Democracy’s Library has uploaded more than one petabyte of material to the Filecoin network, including information from the “[End of Term Crawl](https://eotarchive.org/)” that captures and saves U.S. government websites at the end of presidential administrations.

The Internet Archive is a 501(c)(3) non-profit building a digital library of Internet sites and other cultural artifacts in digital form.
