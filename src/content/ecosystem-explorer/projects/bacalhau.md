Bacalhau is a platform for fast, cost-efficient, and secure computation by running jobs where the data is generated and stored. It supports large-scale parallel compute of Filecoin data. Bacalhau's Compute Providers (CPs) can run a Bacalhau compute node and participate in the Bacalhau compute network, regardless of whether they are hosting Filecoin data.
