At Hashguard, we're building the future of data privacy and security. Our vision is to enable every individual and business to regain control of their digital information, with a focus on security, simplicity and uninterrupted data access. We aim to eliminate concerns about data loss due to hardware failure, hacker attacks or human error.

**Technical approach**

To realize this vision, we use cutting-edge technologies such as asymmetric encryption to ensure that only authorized people have access to your data, and blockchain to ensure data integrity. We've also introduced account abstraction (EIP4337), a revolutionary innovation that eliminates the time-consuming management of credential's keys. With Hashguard, you don't have to worry about losing keys - we take care of it for you. We're determined to offer a decentralized storage solution that's both secure and accessible to all, where your data remains truly yours, anytime, anywhere.
