The Museum of Crypto Art is an art preservation tool and community of artists, collectors, and developers collaborating to decentralize the curation of the Museum and development of open source tools for virtual world construction, and crypto art metadata experimentation. Every artwork activated into the Museum of Crypto Art is permanently backed up — metadata and media file included — onto the Filecoin network.
