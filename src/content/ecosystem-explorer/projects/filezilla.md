The process of transferring $FIL coins to and from the File blockchain can be complex, deterring potential investors. They prefer a straightforward process. Establishing a bridge between Solana and Filecoin would simplify this process, making it more appealing for investors to join the FileCoin chain.

Our Long term goal is to have multiple tokens available for bridging into the FileCoin chain mainnet. Fees collected from bridge transactions will also be used to buy back and burn our own token and to improve the infrastructure and maintenance of the bridge. In the end, we want to be the go-to bridge for onboarding and offboarding assets off of the Filecoin mainnet.
