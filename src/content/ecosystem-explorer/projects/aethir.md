Aethir and Filecoin Foundation have formed an alliance to provide clients with enterprise-grade solutions to support their businesses with decentralized infrastructure. As part of our collaboration with the Filecoin Foundation, Aethir will explore GPU leasing to Filecoin’s storage providers, thus providing Filecoin’s infrastructure network with a reliable and secure source of GPU cloud computing supplies. In parallel to becoming sealing-as-a-service providers, some of Filecoin’s storage providers can borrow GPU capacity from Aethir if they need excess processing power to seal data onto Filecoin’s network.
