Restaking multiplies the power of resources. It was originally derived from the concept of staking in blockchain networks, where users lock up digital currency to secure the network. Restaking extends the utility of these committed resources beyond their primary function. It enables participants to leverage assets already locked to one platform to simultaneously support and secure additional, distinct networks or services.

At Bagel, we’re taking this concept beyond cryptocurrencies to physical computing resources like Graphical Processing Units (GPUs). Through our research, we developed a novel application of restaking principles to computational resources, GPU Restaking. Traditionally, computing resources on peer-to-peer networks are dedicated to one task, such as mining and validating blockchain networks or performing AI workloads. GPU Restaking allows these same physical compute resources to be utilized across multiple platforms concurrently. Especially for machine learning use cases.

Filecoin Foundation and Bagel partnered to launch GPU restaking on the Filecoin miner network. Exclusively available on Bagel’s AI development platform.
