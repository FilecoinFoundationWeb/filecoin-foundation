DALN (Data as Labor Network) represents a paradigm shift from viewing user-generated data as free capital to recognizing it as labor that should be fairly compensated through a data DAO that empowers consumers to turn their credit card transaction data into assets and have direct control over the use and monetization of their data.

DALN confronts several critical problems in the existing alternative data ecosystem:

- Consumers lack ownership and control over their data, despite fueling this lucrative data economy.
- Central intermediaries like card issuers and data brokers currently capture all the value from selling access to aggregated personal data.
- There is a need for a network that can coordinate and pool data in a privacy-preserving way, without concentrating power in centralized entities.
