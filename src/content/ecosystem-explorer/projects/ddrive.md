dDrive is a fully decentralized and open-source Storage which replaces traditional storage providers having centralized governance, cumbersome infrastructure, inadequate security, and privacy measures with users datasets.

dDrive is built on top of IPFS and inherits all the features of Blockchain Technology to emerge as an immutable, censorship-resistant, tamper-proof, and privacy compliant with user dataset.
