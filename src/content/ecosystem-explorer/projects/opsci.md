Opscientia (OpSci) is an open source DeSci project leveraging the power of Web3 to grow, sustain, and continuously improve a decentralized science movement to drive progress in scientific research, making it easier for scientists around the world to share data. The OpSci community’s Commons project is a data commons using Filecoin Plus to provide free archival, indexing, search, and discovery for neuroimaging datasets. OpSci contributors have indexed more than 500TB of high quality open access data into the project’s archives via the Filecoin network.
