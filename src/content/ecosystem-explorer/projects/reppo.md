Reppo is building a sovereign AI modelling network to address DePIN verification and broadly assess the quality of crypto networks. The Reppo chain acts as the execution layer to incentivize domain-specific risk & reputation models to be built and enable a new class of applications at the intersection of crypto and AI.

Reppo began as a Data DAO modeling SP reputation for Filecoin Plus. Since then, we expanded to many other DePINs with learnings from Filecoin client and SP reputation systems, hyper-scaling the impact of risk and reputation models in DePINs and beyond.
