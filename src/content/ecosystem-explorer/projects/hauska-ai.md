Hauska leads in revolutionizing Home Design and Remodeling with AI and Web3 tech. Our platform offers specialized AI design tools, IP protection, decentralized storage, and a Web3 marketplace. Our innovative tools reduce manual sketching time, boosting client acquisition and aiding Design Professionals in closing deals efficiently.

Hauska stands at the forefront of innovation in the Home Design and Remodel industry, pioneering the integration of AI and Web3 technology into specialized applications. Our comprehensive platform is designed to address key challenges faced by professionals in this sector. By offering industry-specific AI design tools, intellectual property protection, decentralized file storage, and a streamlined marketplace, we empower architects, designers, and contractors to enhance their efficiency and competitiveness.

One pressing issue we tackle is the staggering amount of unpaid hours lost annually during the house plan rendering and client acquisition process. This loss not only impacts profitability but also hinders growth opportunities for professionals in the field. To combat this, our DesignPro product enables the creation of exterior and interior photorealistic visualizations in seconds, significantly reducing manual labor and time investment.

Another critical problem we address is the unauthorized use of designers' works to train AI models, leading to potential replication of styles and designs without consent. Our Hauska Drive product leverages cutting-edge AI technology to limit the ability of Learning-Based Language Models (LLMs) to train on our clients' proprietary designs, safeguarding their intellectual property rights.

Furthermore, we recognize the growing demand for decentralized storage solutions that offer enhanced availability, cost-effectiveness, security, reliability, and data privacy beyond traditional cloud storage providers. Our platform provides professionals with access to decentralized file storage options that meet these evolving needs, ensuring their data remains secure and accessible at all times.

Additionally, Hauska addresses the challenge architects and builders face in monetizing their designs by enabling passive income generation from prior works. By facilitating multiple sales of plans and integrating with design tools for quick rendering of customizable visualizations appealing to buyers, we empower professionals to maximize their revenue streams efficiently.

Moreover, our marketplace enhancements include transparent visibility into digital ownership of plans, addressing a key limitation in existing platforms. By providing a seamless experience for both sellers and buyers through improved integrations with design tools and rapid rendering capabilities showcasing plans in various contexts, we elevate the marketplace standards within the industry.

In essence, Hauska's innovative solutions not only streamline processes and enhance efficiency but also safeguard intellectual property rights, promote passive income generation, offer decentralized storage options, and improve marketplace transparency. By addressing these critical challenges faced by professionals in the Home Design and Remodel industry, we contribute to a more sustainable and prosperous ecosystem for all stakeholders involved.
