We built Clover, the DAO framework for the FVM. Using Clover, you can easily spin up a new DAO on FVM, or manage your existing DAO with our suite of tools. Clover's suite of features include: - DAO chats: Clover's DAO chats are end-to-end encrypted using Diffie Hellman's cryptography. - DAO Meetings: We integrate with Huddle01's SDK for decentralized Real-Time Communication. - DAO Storage: We make use of Filecoin's storage processes for all DAO storage. This is limited to 50GB per DAO, for a start. - Voting Campaigns: We provide complete on-chain voting for DAOs, on the Filecoin Virtual Machine.
