Expanso helps leading organizations innovate quickly by helping them architect, implement, and maintain enterprise-grade distributed compute platforms. In fact, Expanso is the same team that created and currently maintains the industry-leading open-source software Bacalhau, built to improve cost and efficiency of processing large-scale datasets in distributed environments. Bacalhau is a platform for public, transparent, and optionally verifiable distributed computation. It enables users to run arbitrary Docker containers and WebAssembly (wasm) images as tasks against data stored in the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS).
