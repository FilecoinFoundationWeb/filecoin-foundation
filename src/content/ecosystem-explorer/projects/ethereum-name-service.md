ENS seeks to serve as the DNS for the Web3 space. DNS is the system that allows you to go into your browser and type in the address "www.google.com" and for the computers working diligently in the background to know that what you really meant was the IP address "142.250.191.46". DNS acts as a translation layer between humans and machines to improve our experience on the web. This is precisely the role ENS plays in Web3: it acts as a translation layer, providing users with simple, memorable names like "nick.eth" instead of typing out lengthy hexadecimal address such as "0xb8c2C29ee19D8307cb7255e1Cd9CbDE883A267d5."
