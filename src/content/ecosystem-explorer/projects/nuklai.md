One of the key aspects of Nuklai’s technology and vision of creating a collaborative data ecosystem is metadata, i.e., data that deeply describes a dataset.

Metadata is like the table of contents and index in a book—they provide a detailed guide to the contents, making it easier to find and understand specific information within the larger work.

Nuklai stores its metadata on Filecoin. We believe in making metadata universally accessible, like a community library enriched by everyone’s contributions.

The combined technologies of Filecoin and Nuklai enable us to build a ‘Wikipedia for Data.’ This is essential to further enable data-driven business models, train AI, and improve equitable access to data, ultimately creating a unified ecosystem.
