Hippocrat project leverages Filecoin for securely storing encrypted user healthcare data, utilizing the Lighthouse SDK for efficient integration. By harnessing the decentralized storage power of Filecoin, we ensure that sensitive healthcare information is securely encrypted before being stored, providing both confidentiality and integrity. This approach also enhances data availability and durability while benefiting from the decentralized nature of the Filecoin network, which reduces the risk of data loss or tampering.
