Fileverse is a Web3 file-sharing tool leveraging peer-to-peer storage networks like IPFS. Fileverse serves individuals, DAOs, Web3 companies, content creators, and NFT communities with an open and composable alternative to todayâ€™s tools. Users can use wallets to create, store, manage, and share content including collaboration documents, blogs, personal notes, web pages, contracts, and more. Additionally, each Fileverse Portal is a self-deployed smart contract, which can run on Filecoin Virtual Machine.
