The Collective DAO is a non-custodial liquid staking protocol built on top of the Filecoin network that lets users stake their FIL and receive clFIL (Collective Filecoin) in exchange. Staked FIL is distributed among storage providers who use the capital to expand their mining operations.

Collectif DAO is a non-custodial liquid staking protocol aligned with Filecoin economy. It lets users stake their FIL and share block rewards with Storage Providers. Staked FIL is distributed among a pre-selected set of Storage Providers who are capable to use this capital to expand their mining operations in the most effective way. 100% slashing protection is guaranteed by liquid FIL collateral provided by SPs and their locked rewards.
