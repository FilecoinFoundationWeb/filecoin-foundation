StarChain integrates the Filecoin network to provide decentralized storage solutions within our DataStore application. By utilizing Filecoin's robust and secure storage capabilities, we ensure that data stored on our platform is immutable, verifiable, and accessible.

Specifically, we use IPFS for efficient content addressing and Filecoin for incentivized storage, enabling our users to store and retrieve data in a decentralized manner.
