  Pioneering storage of large geospatial datasets from satellites on the
  decentralized web
f_description: >-
  FFDW has partnered with researchers from the University of Maryland in the
  Department of Geographical Sciences to ensure that large geospatial datasets
  are accessible by research organizations and the general public. This project
  has the potential to benefit in particular those organizations responsible for
  planning, research, and decision-making where location matters. Some expected
  uses of this data include predicting weather patterns and responding to
  extreme weather events, understanding the many implications of climate change,
  promoting sustainable, just, and optimized cities, and ensuring national
  security.
