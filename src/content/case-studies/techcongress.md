f_preview-text: Providing fellowships so technologists can advise legislators
f_description: >-
  Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web (FFDW) is partnering with
  TechCongress, an organization that provides fellowships to bridge the
  informational gap between technologists and policymakers in Congress.
  TechCongress does this by placing computer scientists, engineers, and other
  technologists on Capitol Hill to serve as technology advisors to members of
  Congress. For instance, Sunmin Kim, fellow and alumni with Sen. Brian Schatz,
  led the effort to pass the OPEN Government Data Act into law in 2018 and 2019.
  The law requires all non-sensitive federal government data to be open and
  machine readable, and requires every federal agency to create a Chief Data
  Officer.
