f_preview-text: Using decentralized storage for space-based services
f_description: >-
  Filecoin Foundation (FF) and Lockheed Martin are working together to develop a
  program for deploying the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) in space. The
  space economy is rapidly emerging, and space-based services are increasingly
  used for everything from communication, to GPS, to environmental monitoring.
  As more tools are put into orbit, and as private space development and
  exploration continues, building out communications infrastructure in space is
  key to ensuring the space economy can thrive. This collaboration is the next
  step in establishing critical infrastructure that will transform how we share
  and access data in space.
