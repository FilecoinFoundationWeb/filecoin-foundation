## Mid-April Highlights

ðŸ‡­ðŸ‡° Thanks for joining FIL Hong Kong, hosted by ND Labs! Hundreds of developers, storage providers, clients, and ecosystem partners came together for two exciting days of talks focused on Web3 trends, decentralized storage, DePIN, and more. Check out [FF's YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@filecoinfoundation) channel to catch your favorite talks from Hong Kong.

ðŸ’¾ [Internet Archive is hosting the Aruba Collection](https://blog.archive.org/2024/04/08/aruba-launches-digital-heritage-portal-preserving-its-history-and-culture-for-global-access/), preserving documents from the Aruba National Library, National Archives, and more! For years, Arubaâ€™s memory institutions have been digitizing historical materials. Now, with the help of Internet Archive, the Aruba Collection is available to anyone, anywhere. The collection is being uploaded to the Filecoin network for long-term preservation as an additional layer of protection, thanks to a longstanding relationship between the Internet Archive and Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web (FFDW).

ðŸ’¼ Filecoin Foundation hosted the first Data Clients Working Group call on April 10. Participants focused on answering key questions regarding their data upload experience to the network, such as identifying hurdles with uploading data; possible solutions to help make the data uploading process easier, smoother, faster, cheaper, etc.; and how the Filecoin ecosystem can better support data onboarding. The next meeting is tentatively scheduled for July 10.Â To join, please reach out to [dataclients@fil.org](dataclients@fil.org).
