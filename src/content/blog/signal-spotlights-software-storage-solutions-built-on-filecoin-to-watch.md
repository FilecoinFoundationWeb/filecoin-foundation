There are dozens of ways to store data on Filecoin. From user-friendly mobile apps to enterprise-grade data onboarding platforms, the Filecoin ecosystem includes a range of tools designed to cater to different storage needs. Whether you prioritize perpetual archiving, data privacy, or seamless integration with Web3 applications, there's a Filecoin-based solution tailored to your requirements. This vibrant ecosystem empowers users to take control of their data, leveraging the power of decentralization, encryption, and robust storage optimization techniques.

As a continuation of Filecoin Foundation’s recent outline of [key initiatives and community involvement to drive widespread decentralized storage adoption](https://fil.org/blog/driving-widespread-filecoin-adoption-key-initiatives-and-community-involvement-in-2024), let’s explore some of the growing software services making a big impact in the Filecoin ecosystem. 

## Lighthouse

Lighthouse, a perpetual data storage solution built on the Filecoin network, lets users make storage deals once, and store their files perpetually. Lighthouse incorporates encryption features and access control mechanisms to enhance data security and privacy.

Lighthouse focuses on serving as a decentralized storage layer for Web3 projects and applications across various sectors like NFTs, AI, and DePIN. The platform aims to cater to the storage requirements of blockchain ecosystems by offering tailored services aligned with the principles of decentralization.

What’s new with Lighthouse? Eternal AI, a Bitcoin L2 blockchain powered by Bitcoin Virtual Machine designed explicitly for executing AI smart contracts and storing AI models, will use Filecoin’s scalable storage layer via Lighthouse for storing AI models. Learn more. 

## CIDgravity

CIDgravity is a marketplace streamlining enterprise and ISV data onboarding onto Filecoin, providing a cost-effective and automated pathway using a zero-knowledge solution. With over 38 PiB of live data and 44 million transactions across 200 miners globally, CIDgravity is a premier data onboarding solution within the Filecoin ecosystem, driving the adoption of decentralized storage.

CIDgravity focuses on deal matching and tracking while enabling direct data access between clients and storage providers in the Filecoin ecosystem. With 540 clients served, CID Gravity offers a comprehensive pricing and client management solution tailored for Filecoin storage providers.

CIDgravity is a great tool for enterprises and independent software vendors looking to onboard and store extensive data volumes. Platform features include real-time service provider availability tracking, customized reputation scoring, and tailored price-matching algorithms.

What’s new with CIDgravity? With the launch of the CIDgravity Gateway, clients can now find the right storage providers and onboard data onto Filecoin easily. 

## GhostDrive

GhostDrive is a data storage platform prioritizing privacy and security through encryption, decentralization, and novel storage optimization techniques. 

Ghost Drive offers data redundancy and security through encryption and features like data tokenization, designed for efficient and secure digital asset management. Ghost Drive also provides storage optimization by employing a compression algorithm that reduces file sizes without compromising data integrity, allowing users to store more data within the same capacity. For example, 1TB of uncompressed data could occupy approximately 2TB of optimized storage. 

What’s new with Ghost Drive? GhostDrive is now available on the Apple App Store or Google Play Store, bringing the power of decentralized storage to your mobile devices. With the GhostDrive app, users can effortlessly manage their data; add, delete, or pin files to their node; and monitor the status and integrity of their digital assets within the Filecoin network.
