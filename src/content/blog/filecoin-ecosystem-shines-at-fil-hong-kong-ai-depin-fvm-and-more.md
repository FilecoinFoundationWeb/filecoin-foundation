The Filecoin ecosystem was on full display at FIL Hong Kong, hosted by ND Labs and supported by Filecoin Foundation.

The Filecoin ecosystem was on full display at [FIL Hong Kong](https://www.fil.org/events/fil-hong-kong-hosted-by-ndlabs), hosted by ND Labs and supported by Filecoin Foundation. Hundreds of attendees from around the world gathered in the burgeoning Web3 hub of Hong Kong to explore the latest developments in the Filecoin ecosystem and envision the future of decentralized storage.

Spread across three days of talks and presentations, reps from many exciting projects built on the Filecoin network came together to share their latest developments in decentralized AI tech, decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN), and Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM) projects.

## Highlights from Filecoin & Storage Provider Day

Filecoin & Storage Provider Day on April 6 focused on driving broader ecosystem growth. Jen King and Mara McMahon from the FilStor/DeStor team shared insights on aligning product strategies with customer needs to drive Filecoin adoption.

Leveraging her experience crafting customer-led product strategies, King detailed how a well-defined product market fit is essential for startups and established companies alike, as it ensures that their products not only meet the existing demands of the market but also seamlessly integrate into customers’ workflows.

## FVM and DePIN Take Center Stage

Day two of FIL Hong Kong dove deep into the cutting-edge applications and advancements shaping the Filecoin ecosystem, with a focus on the FVM and DePIN. Jason Sarria-Solis of Filliquid highlighted how the introduction of FVM has transformed the Filecoin ecosystem, unlocking new opportunities within the open data economy. Victor Chen from Fog Works then introduced the Foggie Max DePIN Server, an expandable DePIN server for personal use.

## Web3 Festival Showcases Filecoin's Potential

The final day of FIL Hong Kong took place on a dedicated stage at Web3 Festival, where attendees gained a deeper understanding of Filecoin's integration with other technologies. Filecoin Foundation Founding Officer Clara Tsao outlined the various pathways for participation in the ecosystem. She highlighted some of the major organizations that currently have data stored on the Filecoin network, such as NASA, Solana, and the National Library of Medicine.

FF’s Yan Bo Ng explored the potential of integrating FVM with artificial intelligence to enhance data processing capabilities across the Filecoin network. He emphasized the potential for FVM to serve as a backbone for AI applications, highlighting the synergy between decentralized storage and advanced computational technologies.

Titan Network’s Konstantin Tkachuk presented on the transformative potential of using idle edge devices within the framework of DePIN. “In order to really capture the DePIN opportunity, and bring this technology closer to people, to you and me, we have to use the resources that are already available in this space,” Tkachuk said. “And by those resources I mean smartphones, tablets, PCs, and other devices that are surrounding us on a day-to-day basis.” Billions of global edge and personal devices, often overlooked Tkachuk said represent a vast untapped resource that could significantly advance the decentralization movement.
