[NV23 upgrade](/blog/announcing-the-filecoin-nv23-waffle-upgrade-enhancing-filecoins-efficiency-and-security), codenamed "Waffle," went live on Mainnet on August 6. This upgrade brings significant enhancements focused on simplified processes, optimized proof mechanisms, streamlined sector commitments, enhanced cryptographic support, and strengthened security. Several Filecoin Improvement Proposals (FIPs), such as [FIP0065](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0065.md), help the network operate more efficiently and lay the groundwork for more flexible data commitment methods.

Messari’s [State of Filecoin Q2 2024 report is out](https://messari.io/report/state-of-filecoin-q2-2024). Read it for a detailed overview of the network, including increased network utilization rates, more data client onboarding, continued network maturation as the DePIN backbone for AI advancements, and more.

## Ecosystem

### Builders Funnel

- Join the [next Developer Working Group (DevWG) meeting](https://lu.ma/n1qa6gj6), August 29. This monthly call connects Filecoin developers and community members to discuss key areas of interest across the developer community. Have questions? Check out our [repo](https://github.com/filecoin-project/DeveloperWG) or connect in the [builder discussion](https://discord.com/channels/1210612276357500978/1234888399647801426) channel in Discord.

### Storage Community

- Several FIPs in the NV23 Waffle upgrade address critical aspects of the network's functionality, including [FIP0065](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0065.md), which simplifies the network's circulating supply calculation by excluding the locked balances of the built-in market actor, preparing for direct data commitments without requiring market deals.
- [Filecoin Fast Finality (F3) was accepted](https://x.com/FilFoundation/status/1821594124581048654). This change reduces finalization time from approximately 7.5 hours to ~15 minutes using existing information and without protocol changes, addressing a key barrier for apps, exchanges, and interoperability.

## Network Operations

### Governance

- Check out the latest one-pager on [FIP0093](https://x.com/fil_gov/status/1821976035644338597). This proposal aims to set the balance of the mining reserve (address f090) to zero, effectively removing 282.9 million FIL tokens from potential future use. This action would reduce the total supply of FIL to approximately 1.717 billion. [Join the full discussion on GitHub](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/discussions/1030).
- FIP one-pagers are high-level summary documents prepared by the FF Governance team. They are intended to provide an overview of recently opened FIPs and should not be considered exhaustive or final representations of the proposals. These summaries reflect the current state of discussion and are meant to inform the community.
- [Watch the most recent Filecoin Core Developers call](https://youtu.be/ibkfXroadU8?feature=shared), diving into new proposals, the NV23 Waffle Upgrade, and the timeline discussion for NV24.
