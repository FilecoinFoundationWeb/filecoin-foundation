_New joint award program supports Web3 education and learning_

We are excited to announce that Filecoin Foundation and [Unfinished](https://unfinished.com/) are launching Explorer Awards, a joint program to support the growth of the decentralized web movement and help others catalyze their Web3 learning.

The Explorer Awards is a $100,000 funding pool that will disperse between $1,000 and $10,000 to support projects that are advancing learning and development in decentralized technology. The award is intended to fund anything from an NFT workshop to a metaverse exhibition to a Web3 dinner event. And we’re ready to hear about any initiative that furthers work and knowledge in the Web3 space.

Both Filecoin Foundation and Unfinished share an underlying commitment to using decentralized technology to build a better internet. Filecoin Foundation (FF) is an independent organization that supports the growth of the Filecoin ecosystem and advocates for Filecoin and the decentralized web. Unfinished designs and develops systems for a healthier digital society–transforming how the internet works and who benefits from the digital economy.

As we’re seeing [incredible growth](https://medium.com/electric-capital/electric-capital-developer-report-2021-f37874efea6d) in the Web3 space, Filecoin Foundation and Unfinished will help more people learn about the benefits of decentralized technology and why it’s critical in building the next generation of the web. The Explorer Awards program will fund activists, artists, developers, hackers, and passionate learners who are ready to learn about decentralized technology and explore what it takes to create a web that works better for everyone.

We’re living in an age where very few entities control the vast amount of information on the internet, and that information is vulnerable to single points of failure. Decentralized technology can enable a better future — where users have more control over their data. This joint initiative will support that trajectory — bringing more people from different backgrounds into the space and providing resources for education and learning.
