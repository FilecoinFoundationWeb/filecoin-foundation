f_description: The basis of the work by DeSci Labs is to build tools and
  infrastructure that make reproducible science with low barriers to access a
  reality. DeSci Labs is a team of scientists and engineers bringing a modern
  approach to the future of scientific research, with the perspective of having
  used siloed data and centralized systems for years without significant
  progress. The vision is a world without vendor lock-in, paywalls, proprietary
  analytics, link rot and fake science.

Key Highlights:

* The “Replication Crisis,” the notion that results reported in scientific papers are frequently unable to be reproduced and independently verified by other researchers, has been an [open secret](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/21504366/science-replication-crisis-peer-review-statistics) within the scientific community for several decades now.
* This is problematic because rigorous testing and replication of studies by other researchers is a  foundational component of advancing scientific knowledge. **Research cannot be appropriately evaluated and used for future projects if the tools needed to replicate it are lacking.**
* [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/533452a) reported in 2016 that 70 percent of researchers had tried and failed to reproduce another scientist's experiment. A 2023 [report](https://www.npr.org/2023/05/14/1176062276/fake-studies-in-academic-journals-may-be-more-common-than-previously-thought) suggests that 28 percent of all biomedical [papers](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.05.06.23289563v1) published in the medical field are either "made up or plagiarized" outright, while others [suggest](https://www.ft.com/content/76abf920-effb-4d66-8fb2-3ff842150297) that number may be much higher. Suffice to say that **it is difficult to discern when scientific studies, even when published in reputable journals, can be fully trusted.**
* This problem has existed for decades because:

  * There exists a lack of incentives for scientists to embrace replicability. 
  * The **scientific world lacks a robust technology stack** that can enable knowledge sharing for easy reproducibility;  the infrastructure does not exist currently to do this quickly, easily, and cheaply.
* Solving science’s Replication Crisis is the basis of the work by [DeSci Labs](https://www.desci.com/), which aims to address these challenges by leveraging decentralized technologies like lnterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and Filecoin, which operate "under the hood" of its scientific publication app called [DeSci Nodes](https://nodes.desci.com/web).
* **Filecoin provides a needed solution** by making storage affordable, preventing vendor lock-in and fostering a culture of openness. By storing research objects in a decentralized repository, it becomes possible to share the entire research object with data and code, provide versioning, and ensure reproducibility.  
* By embracing open science principles and leveraging decentralized web technologies such as **Filecoin and IPFS, the scientific community can overcome the challenges posed by the lack of transparency and reproducibility.** These tools are the foundation of DeSci Labs’ vision for creating an open-access network without paywalls, barriers, and vendor lock-in, where scientific data is stored and accessed in a way that facilitates collaboration, transparency, and the free flow of knowledge.
