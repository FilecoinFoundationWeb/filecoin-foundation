We are excited to announce that the Filecoin Foundation has been accepted as a member of [Blockchain for Europe](https://www.blockchain4europe.eu/) (BC4EU), a leading voice on EU blockchain policy.

Based in Brussels, Blockchain for Europe advocates for blockchain innovation through policy in Europe and beyond. The organization brings together a global group of member organizations united by their shared commitment to developing, promoting, and supporting blockchain technology. Members collaborate with policymakers, academics, and regulators in the European Union and beyond to craft the regulatory and legal frameworks that will help make blockchain technology a success.

“We are excited to become part of the Blockchain for Europe community to advocate for policy that supports blockchain innovation worldwide,” said Marta Belcher, board chair of the Filecoin Foundation. “We are grateful for the opportunity to join this group of industry leaders as we work toward building and growing the decentralized web.”

Other members of Blockchain for Europe include Billon, Binance, Block.One, Blockseed Ventures, Botlabs/KILT, CELO, cLabs, Electroneum, Fetch.ai, Nimiq, Osom/Polybius, Parity, Ripple, and the Web3 Foundation.
