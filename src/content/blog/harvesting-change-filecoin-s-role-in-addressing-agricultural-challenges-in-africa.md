The intersection of blockchain technology and agriculture is opening up new frontiers for sustainable farming practices and supply chain management. Recently, a group of university students and developers explored how the Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM) can address agricultural challenges in Africa. The Filecoin Orbit event took place at Dedan Kimathi University in Kenya, hosted byBlockchainHub DEKUT.

Filecoin Orbit ambassador Allan Mang'eni chatted with FF about the potential impact of Filecoin on the rural agricultural sector.

## _What would you say are the biggest agricultural challenges in the region, and how Filecoin can help address these challenges?_

Authenticity and quality of products, environmental sustainability, crop insurance, and lack of smart farming practices are all agricultural challenges that the Filecoin network can help address.

Supply chain transparency presents a solution to the questions around authenticity and quality of products. Filecoin can provide a transparent and immutable ledger for transactions in an effort to prevent fraud and counterfeiting.

Filecoin could also be used to introduce incentives and reward models for sustainable farming practices in order to promote environmental sustainability. The current lack of smart farming practices in some regions tends to lower crop yields and raise operational costs, and bringing real time data onchain can create smart farms where resources are allocated more efficiently and reducing waste in farming.

Plus, smart contracts can automate the crop insurance process to ensure timely compensation in case of crop yield failure or other disasters.

We see Filecoin playing an important role in enhancing smart farming practices in Kenya and the rest of Africa.

## _Tell us more about the event you hosted and what you discussed?_

The Filecoin Orbit Enhancing Green Agriculture event was hosted at Dedan Kimathi University in collaboration with Blockchain Hub DEKUT. Over 60 participants, including developers and entrepreneurs, were keen to explore innovative solutions for smart farming and how to use Filecoin to do it.

In addition to an intro to Filecoin technology stack, we also discussed how machine learning algorithms can analyze weather patterns and other environmental factors to provide farmers with valuable insights and help them make more informed decisions.

We also explored a use case from YYTZ, a cashew processing company based in Tanzania that has integrated blockchain into its operations to enhance transparency, traceability and efficiency. This has ensured farmers get fair compensation for their products and also helps streamline their supply chain.

The audience response was quite good, and we ended up having an ideation session. In groups of 10, we discussed and shared ideas on some products we can build to enhance farming practices. Over the coming months, we hope to have a hackathon at Dedan Kimathi University, where we will bring these ideas to life.

## _Describe your experience as an Orbit ambassador._

As a Filecoin Orbit lead in Kenya, I have been actively involved in creating awareness on the benefits of decentralized storage and computing on the Filecoin network. Our efforts involve hosting workshops, speaking at conferences, and networking with developers and entrepreneurs to grow a community that can facilitate a shift from web2 to Web3.

My experience with the Filecoin Foundation has been incredibly positive. They have been instrumental in providing resources for our events, which has been a tremendous help. Our team of volunteers and the media team plays a crucial role in the logistics and overall success of the events. Additionally, the support from student clubs at different universities in Kenya has been invaluable in organizing and executing these events. Their involvement has made a significant impact, and I am grateful for their dedication and enthusiasm.

## _Is there anything else you would like to add?_

We are excited about what the future entails within the Filecoin ecosystem. The FVM capabilities of the network is a game changer for our space, and we aim to grow a network of contributors from Kenya and, at the same time, an ecosystem of developers and entrepreneurs who can build solutions on Filecoin.

Thank you, Allan!!

The Filecoin Orbit event at Dedan Kimathi University demonstrated the potential of Filecoin in improving agriculture across Africa. The intersection of blockchain and agriculture can create more efficient and sustainable farming systems. We are blown away by the enthusiasm from Kenya and look forward to seeing more Filecoin applications in agriculture!
