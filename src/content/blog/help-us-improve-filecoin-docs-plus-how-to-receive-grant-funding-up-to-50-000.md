Filecoin Foundation awards grant funding for critical development projects to foster a more decentralized, efficient, and robust foundation for humanity’s information.

Currently, we’re looking to support projects that enhance existing [Filecoin documentation](https://docs.filecoin.io/) or create new educational resources. We’ve introduced a new grant category called Documentation Enhancement and we’re looking for proposals that fit within the following focus areas:

- Tutorial Creation: Create tutorials and walkthroughs demonstrating how to use Filecoin APIs, SDKs, and tools for common use cases (such as storing and retrieving data, managing storage deals, interacting with smart contracts, etc.)
- Comprehensive Developer Guides: Develop detailed guides for developers covering various aspects of integrating Filecoin into their projects, including setup instructions, API usage, and troubleshooting tips.
- Interactive Learning Resources: Develop interactive learning resources such as code playgrounds or interactive demos/videos that allow developers to experiment with Filecoin APIs and tools.

## Filecoin Documentation Enhancement Grants

Applicants must meet the following criteria to receive a Filecoin Documentation Enhancement Grant (up to $5,000):

- A clear plan to improve existing Filecoin documentation or create new resources.
- A clear description of the project.
- Ability to complete this work within 3 months of signing a grant agreement.
- Agree to open-source the enhanced documentation, via a suitable license.
- Agree to provide regular progress updates.
- Provide additional information, as required, during the contracting and invoicing process.

## Open Grants

Filecoin Foundation’s flagship grants program, Open Grants, supports novel ideas that advance the Filecoin ecosystem, bring significant new usage, or directly advance the Filecoin mission statement to preserve humanity’s most important information with funding available up to $50,000 per project.

In 2024, the FF Grants Program is looking for proposals that address:

- Developer and Data Tooling: For projects that close important experience gaps for developers or large dataset users. This might include command line or visual UX improvements, API advancements, data preparation and ingest tools, developer tools and infrastructure, and more.
- Integrations: For projects that add integration or support for Filecoin into popular, or fast-growing, existing tools and developer communities in Web2 or Web3.
- Research and Protocols: For projects aimed at [improving the foundations of Filecoin](https://www.glacier.io/filecoin), for example, Layer 2 solutions that facilitate data onboarding or provable storage networks using the Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM).
- Storage: For research and development of scalable solutions in storage markets including improved data onboarding tools.
- Retrieval: For projects focused on retrieval solutions for Filecoin. This would include tools that optimize retrieval services and enhance user experiences in the wider retrieval ecosystem.
- Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM): Projects may include rollups, leasing protocols, and other strategic integrations of Filecoin with both new and existing tools or protocols.

## Grant Graduates

Grant graduates have gone on to make a huge impact in the Filecoin ecosystem. You can look at recent grant recipients in [FF’s 2023 Annual Report](https://www.figma.com/proto/OpRYFQO34ycc5N7YIMeGAe/2023-FF-Annual-Report?node-id=1-11370). Here are a few highlights:

- [Portrait](https://portrait.gg/): An open-source web page builder that lets you turn your blockchain address into a website. Portrait web pages are automatically pinned to IPFS and stored on Filecoin, making the sites secure and resilient by design. Portrait’s goal is to enable communities to develop creative work in a decentralized way –– from custom blogs for writers, to online portfolios for designers, to landing pages for podcast hosts.
- [Cavalry](https://cavalry.scenegroup.co/): 2D animation software for Mac and Windows. Users can create generative, abstract artwork for dynamic rendering in Cavalry, and automatically upload all generated artworks to NFT.storage, which provides storage using IPFS and Filecoin.
- [Fileverse](https://fileverse.io/): A Web3 file-sharing tool leveraging peer-to-peer storage networks. Fileverse serves individuals, DAOs, Web3 companies, content creators, and NFT communities with an open and composable alternative to today’s tools. Users can use wallets to create, store, manage, and share content including collaboration documents, blogs, personal notes, web pages, contracts, and more. Plus, each Fileverse Portal is a self-deployed smart contract that can run on the FVM.
- [The Museum of Crypto Art](https://app.museumofcryptoart.com/): An art preservation tool and community of artists, collectors, and developers collaborating to decentralize the curation of the Museum and development of open-source tools for virtual world construction, and crypto art metadata experimentation. Every artwork activated into the Museum of Crypto Art is permanently backed up — metadata and media files included — onto the Filecoin network.
- [FileDrive](https://filedrive.io): Focused on research and development for distributed storage on the Filecoin network. They’re building tools, applications, solutions, and infrastructure for all data to create value in Web3.
