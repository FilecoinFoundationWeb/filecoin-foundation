## Early April Highlights

ðŸ“– **Filecoin Foundation is now accepting article abstracts from the community for the inaugural edition of the Filecoin Ecosystem Digest.** Published by FF and guest edited by Ansa Researchâ€™s Jonathan Victor, the digest will feature articles from ecosystem contributors sharing their vision for the web's future and how decentralized storage applications will play a part. To apply, fill out the [Filecoin Ecosystem Digest interest form](https://airtable.com/appQReX5uAegC0yom/pagoKQqs5z4LCWleW/form).

ðŸ§° **Filecoin Foundationâ€™s [Comms Toolkit](https://hub.fil.org/comms) is live!** This new site connects you with FFâ€™s Marketing and Communications team so we can help spread the word about projects you're building and the work youâ€™re doing in the Filecoin ecosystem. Fill out this [intake form](https://airtable.com/appNJXvQHmep8Dx9E/shr3Kc8Ort7T5ehuX), and our team will follow up with you to help you tell your story.

ðŸ“ˆ**Submissions to the Filecoin Ecosystem Explorer have doubled since its launch in January!** The [Ecosystem Explorer](https://fil.org/ecosystem/) is a crowd-sourced and open database that showcases the incredible breadth of projects in the Filecoin ecosystem. Thank you to all of those who have submitted use cases and applications! If youâ€™re working on something in the Filecoin ecosystem and donâ€™t yet see your project, submit your application to the Explorer [here](https://airtable.com/apppNMXvdW3i9P1BY/shrvrv4B9JKCP1e4O).

## Ecosystem

**Developer Advocacy**

- Twenty-one teams submitted Filecoin-related projects in the Dora Hacks [Data Economy Hackathon](https://dorahacks.io/hackathon/filecoin-data-economy). Teams focused on scalability, building on Filecoin, and maximizing data utility. Winners will be announced April 15.
- FF Developer Advocate Jenks Guo judged the [Filecoin track at ETH London](https://ethglobal.com/events/london2024/prizes/filecoin), which drew 26 submissions and offered six top prizes.

**Storage**

- FFâ€™s Community & Data Onboarding team hosted its first [Network Growth 2.0 call](https://filecoinproject.slack.com/archives/C02GQUMFQVA/p1711138050905809) on March 22, where builders throughout the ecosystem came together to give a high-level view of what theyâ€™re working on. The first call featured Cloud Forest, Web3Mine, CID Gravity, Seal Storage, and more. Join the [\#global-storage-provider-community](https://filecoinproject.slack.com/archives/C02GQUMFQVA) Slack channel for details on future meetings.
- The Decentralized Storage Alliance (DSA), of which FF is a founding member, [announced a leap forward in zk proof computation](https://dsalliance.io/resources/blog/dsa-announces-leap-forward-in-zk-proof-computation) on the Filecoin network. These advances optimize several key steps in the proof process via CPU and GPU optimizations. The result is an 80% reduction in cost and latency for proof generation â€“ saving storage providers money, and increasing flexibility in how they use their hardware.

## Network Operations

**Governance**

- The FF Governance team held its monthly Community Governance Call on March 25. Subscribe to the [governance calendar](https://bit.ly/3T4NKAa) to get the meeting details and to stay updated.
- Nv22 Dragon remains on track for April 11. There are four FIPs in scope for this upgrade:

  - [FIP0063](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0063.md) - Switching to a new Drand mainnet network
  - [FIP0074](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0074.md) - Remove cron-based automatic deal settlement
  - [FIP0076](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0076.md) - Direct data onboarding
  - [FIP0083](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0083.md) - Ecosystem tooling: adding built-in actor events in verified registry, miner & market actors

- The first DataCap distributions have started to go out to allocators. The initial amount of 5 PiB allows new allocators to begin distributing while developing their diligence and bookkeeping records.
