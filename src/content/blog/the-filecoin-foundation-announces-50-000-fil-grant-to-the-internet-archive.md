The Filecoin Foundation is committed to protecting and preserving valuable data by creating a new internet infrastructure that’s more secure, user-focused, and competitive. We also want the Filecoin network to protect and preserve humanity’s most valuable information, whether it’s books or movies, software or websites, music and podcasts, and so much more.

Today, we’re thrilled to announce that the Filecoin Foundation has committed 50,000 FIL to the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/), one of the largest libraries in the world and a key defender of information and accessibility. This donation will advance the mission of both organizations to preserve humanity’s most valuable data and improve access to information online.

The Internet Archive runs dozens of projects, including the [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/), a repository of 475 billion webpages; [OpenLibrary.org](https://openlibrary.org/), a free, digital lending library of over 4.6 million eBooks; [Software Collections](https://archive.org/details/software), designed to preserve and provide access to rare or difficult to find software titles that enable gamers to play them through emulation; and [Community Webs](https://communitywebs.archive-it.org/), which trains, supports, and provides web archiving resources to public librarians at institutions across the U.S. and Canada. It also hosts the [Filecoin Archives](http://blog.archive.org/tag/filecoin/), a community-led project to curate, disseminate and preserve important open access to information often at risk of being lost.

Founded in 1996 by Internet Hall of Fame member Brewster Kahle, the Internet Archive now serves more than 1.5 million patrons each day, providing access to more than 70 petabytes of data — books, web pages, music, television, and software — and working with more than 800 library and university partners. Its mission is to provide universal access to all knowledge. We’re also lucky to have Brewster on the board of advisors for both the Filecoin Foundation and the Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web, along with the Archives’ Director of Partnerships Wendy Hanamura.

The Filecoin Foundation’s contribution to the Internet Archive will advance the mission of both organizations to preserve humanity’s most valuable information and improve access to information online. We’ll continue to work side-by-side with the Internet Archive to promote this vision and will post updates on this blog as the work continues.
