This year, the Filecoin Orbit program helped seed a new crop of thousands of builders in the Filecoin ecosystem. The [Filecoin Orbit Community Program](https://orbitcommunity.filecoin.io/) is a group of volunteer ambassadors who host Filecoin workshops and hackathons, publish educational Filecoin articles and videos, and build on Filecoin.

Since the program’s launch, 147 Orbit Ambassadors have introduced an estimated 10,000 early-career developers, students, and enthusiasts to the Filecoin ecosystem through 190 workshops and community hackathons in over 40 countries.

Orbit Ambassadors hosted events in Austin, San Francisco, Miami, Buenos Aires, Mexico City, Rio, Zurich, Paris, Madrid, Casablanca, Lagos, Dar es Salaam, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, Hong Kong, Jakarta, Singapore, Tokyo, Seoul, and many more cities around the world. The program serves as an entry point into the Filecoin Builder’s Funnel, particularly in underrepresented regions.

The Builder’s Funnel is the pipeline to transform the projects of early builders into funded startups. In this process, Orbit serves as a gateway, welcoming builders into the ecosystem to learn about Filecoin. From there, they may participate in a hackathon, apply for a Filecoin Foundation grant to fund their project, and then grow and scale the project through an accelerator or funding.

In the lead-up to the launch of the Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM) in the spring, volunteer Orbit Ambassadors hosted more than 30 FVM workshops and over 10 FVM hackathons in just as many cities. These events generated 150 new projects deployed on Filecoin, IPFS, or FVM test- and mainnets, like a voting machine FVM dApp from a team in Tanzania.

The Filecoin Orbit program has also enabled the Filecoin ecosystem to engage with the next generation of builders at top universities through workshops at their hackathons, blockchain conferences, and blockchain clubs. Orbit Ambassadors delivered educational talks at the University of Oxford, National University of Singapore, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, University of Pennsylvania, Indian Institutes of Technology, University of Lagos, and many more.
