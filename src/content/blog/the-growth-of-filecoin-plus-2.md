The [Filecoin Plus](https://fil.org/governance/#fil-plus) (Fil+) program is a layer of social trust on top of the Filecoin network to help incentivize the storage of real, valuable data sets. Clients looking to onboard data storage onto the network apply to community-selected Notaries to receive DataCap, which can then be used to incentivize storage providers to take storage deals.
