Welcome back to the Developer Grants Updates series! In this second issue, we’re bringing you the latest news and updates from the Filecoin Foundation Developer Grants team. Since August 2024, we have supported new impactful projects and introduced program updates to empower more developers.

## New Grant Opportunity: FIL Builder Next Step Grants

FF is working with [FIL-B](https://fil.builders/) to provide FIL Builder Next Step Grants valued between $5,000 and $10,000. This grant type is intended to support builders taking their active Filecoin projects to the next level!

Are you working on an onchain project on Filecoin with FVM and have either a Proof of Concept or a solid background in Web3 development? This grant might be perfect for you! The full list of criteria and grant scope can be reviewed [here](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/blob/master/Program%20Resources/Builder%20Next%20Step%20Grants.md).

This grant type is open for applications. Please note that the official review process will kick off on December 1, 2024, and will be open until April 30, 2025.

## Submission Overview

We are regularly reviewing proposals from developers and community members within the Filecoin ecosystem that impact developer or data tooling, incorporate an exciting integration, or use [Filecoin Virtual Machine](https://fvm.filecoin.io/) (FVM). A few highlights include:

- [Eastore](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/issues/1770): An onchain way of storing small files on Filecoin. Eastore is built with FVM, allowing users to store files through smart contract transactions. They aim to provide users with an onchain alternative to traditional centralized file storage protocols.
- [UCAN development support](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/issues/1776): A project supporting the development of multiple User Controlled Authorization Network (UCAN) functionalities, including v1 JS UCAN implementation, debugger, and other developer tooling and resources for ecosystem projects using UCANs.
- [IPNI Reverse Index](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/issues/1781): A project aiming to empower developers to build alternative retrieval-probing networks, new reputation systems, and an array of diagnostic tooling.

If you have a project in mind that improves or advances the Filecoin network, we encourage you to apply for a grant! Make sure to check out [our grant criteria](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/blob/master/Program%20Resources/Builder%20Next%20Step%20Grants.md) to inform your proposals.

## Focus Areas and Outlook

In addition to the FIL Builder Next Step Grants, we are continuing to make grants valued at up to $50,000 for projects that align with the following focus areas.

- Developer and Data Tooling: Close important experience gaps for developers building on Filecoin.
- Integrations: Add integration or support for Filecoin into popular or fast-growing tools and developer communities.
- Research and Protocols: For projects aimed at improving the foundations of Filecoin.
- Storage: Research and development of scalable solutions in storage markets including improved data onboarding tools.
- Retrieval: Focus on retrieval solutions for Filecoin such as tools that optimize retrieval services and enhance user experiences in the wider retrieval ecosystem.
- FVM: Projects may include rollups, improvements to core functionality, and integrations of Filecoin with both new and existing tools or protocols.

For those of you looking for the [Documentation Enhancement Grants](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/blob/master/Program%20Resources/Documentation%20Enhancement%20Grants%20README.md) launched in May of this year, it is now included in the [FIL Builder Next Step Grants](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/blob/master/Program%20Resources/Builder%20Next%20Step%20Grants.md). If you would like to contribute to continuous learning and skill development, projects that enhance Filecoin documentation and resources are still submissions we will review.

## Stay connected to the Filecoin Developer Community

There are many ways to receive support within the Filecoin community in addition to applying for a Developer Grant. A great way to find success within the Filecoin developer community is to take advantage of these many opportunities, including:

- Join the [Developer Working Group](https://github.com/filecoin-project/DeveloperWG): This monthly meeting connects Filecoin developers and community members to discuss key areas of interest across the developer community.
- [Take advantage of Filecoin Foundation's Comms Toolkit](https://hub.fil.org/comms): Already building on Filecoin? This site connects you with FF’s Marketing and Communications team so we can help spread the word about the projects you're building and the work you’re doing in the Filecoin ecosystem.
- Join FF's Developer Grants team for [Filecoin Grants Office Hours](https://calendly.com/filecoin-grants/office-hours-ama?month=2024-07) to learn more about the Filecoin Grants program and ask any questions.

Thank you for your interest in the Developer Grants program. Stay tuned for more updates and program developments! Questions for our team? Reach us directly at [grants@fil.org](mailto:grants@fil.org).
