‚≠ê Thanks for joining the [Filecoin ecosystem at Consensus](https://hub.fil.org/consensus-24)! FF hosted the Filecoin booth on the Consensus show floor, where attendees connected with community members and discovered how the Filecoin network enables decentralized AI, compute, and DePIN.

üîé Filecoin Foundation shared its vision for [driving widespread Filecoin adoption and ideas for community engagement](https://fil.org/blog/driving-widespread-filecoin-adoption-key-initiatives-and-community-involvement-in-2024/). As one of many teams in the Filecoin network committed to the growth and success of the protocol, the Foundation outlines what some ecosystem leaders suggest are the keys to further expansion in 2024, including growing the client pipeline, increasing onchain activity, and demonstrating value over centralized storage options.

üìπ The Defiant‚Äôs ETHDenver documentary is now stored on Filecoin. On a recent [DWeb Decoded episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nVyrlf4tqM), The Defiant team uploaded their documentary ‚Äì‚Äì [Meet The Gigabrains Shaping The Future Of Web3](https://youtu.be/ZwRfWwZgyus?si=fN4j49c-3im9FQkS) ‚Äì‚Äì to the Filecoin network. Decentralized storage provides media organizations with increased data security and redundancy, ensuring that their valuable files are protected against single points of failure or data breaches.

## Ecosystem

**Developer Advocacy**

- HackFS, one of the ecosystem's largest annual hackathons, is offering $40,000 in prizes across Filecoin tracks. Running [May 17 - June 7](https://ethglobal.com/events/hackfs2024#schedule), FF Developer Advocates Robert Dowling and Jenks Guo are supporting as project judges and mentors.
- The [Web3 AI Hackathon](https://www.encode.club/web3-ai-hackathon) powered by Encode Club kicked off on May 30 with three Filecoin tracks: Privacy in AI Data, Trusted AI Development, and Filecoin and AI.

**Storage**

- At Consensus, Head of Community Porter Stowell hosted a discussion and demo on AI agents specifically designed for the Filecoin ecosystem at [Theoriq‚Äôs AI Odyssey: Unlocking Web3‚Äôs Next Frontier](https://consensus2024.coindesk.com/agenda/event/-theoriqs-ai-odyssey-unlocking-web3s-next-frontier-344) and gave a lightning talk about Data as an Asset Class. Follow more of the latest discussions across the [storage provider community on Slack](https://filecoinproject.slack.com/archives/C02GQUMFQVA) and tune in to the monthly Network Growth 2.0 call for some of the developments happening across the ecosystem.
- The Foundation hosted the Good Morning Filecoin Ecosystem networking breakfast at Consensus to unite experienced storage providers with newcomers in the Filecoin ecosystem, where attendees discussed advancements in the network and built connections with the community.

## Network Operations

**Governance**

- The FIP 0092 one-pager about a caller-specified proving deadline for NI-PoRep is [available on X](https://x.com/fil_gov/status/1795476606770643042). The FIP proposes allowing SPs to specify the window PoST proving deadline for sectors onboarded with NI-PoRep.
