**On stage at FIL Bangkok, teams unveiled new L2 data storage solutions,** signaling a new era of what’s possible with Filecoin by extending the network's capabilities. Akave, a decentralized, modular L2 solution offering cutting-edge encryption, [announced the launch of its Yucca testnet](https://www.akave.ai/blog/akave-secures-3-45-million-to-accelerate-on-chain-data-management). Storacha, a high-performance decentralized storage solution built with Filecoin, [launched its closed alpha network tailored](https://medium.com/@storacha/storachas-alpha-network-ignites-unleashing-decentralized-hot-storage-on-filecoin-bddad58bd1be) for gaming, AI, and DePIN networks. [Read more ](https://www.fil.org/blog/filecoin-ecosystem-teams-unveil-l2s)about these announcements on our blog. 

**The Filecoin community convened at FIL Dev Summit 5, sponsored by FF.** Filecoin developers, builders, storage providers, and ecosystem members came together as a community to contribute to the exciting trajectory of the Filecoin network. FF’s Clara Tsao led a track on Product Market Fit, and Meghan Gavis ran a track on Web3 marketing. Other FF presenters included Paul Wagner, on Service Classes and SLOs, Fillipa Riberio on UX pitfalls, and Stef Magdalinski and Danny O’Brien on dogfooding, [Watch the full recap](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_0VrY55uV1__uv3uOvZ3L6exG9y10lSy). 

**Filecoin Recognized by Fast Company.** In its fourth annual [Next Big Things in Tech](https://www.fastcompany.com/next-big-things-in-tech/list) list, Fast Company featured the Filecoin Network, honoring emerging technology that has a profound impact on industries—from education and sustainability to robotics and artificial intelligence. As the AI industry rapidly expands – now valued at $9 trillion according to the latest [State of AI Report](https://www.stateof.ai/) – Filecoin’s decentralized storage network offers an open-source alternative for data storage.

## Ecosystem

* Introducing Next Step Builder Grants. Filecoin Foundation is working with FIL-B to provide $5k to $10k support for builders taking their Filecoin projects to the next level! Focus areas include developer and data tooling, integrations, storage, retrieval, technical content creation, and FVM. [Learn more](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/blob/master/Program%20Resources/Builder%20Next%20Step%20Grants.md)! 
* Get ready for Fast Finality in Filecoin (F3), the biggest network upgrade since FVM. F3 is coming to the network in Q1 of 2025, speeding up finality on the network by 450X. With F3, finalization times are reduced from 7.5 hours (900 epochs) to just minutes, improving user experience and opening the door for applications, exchanges, and interoperability to build on the network.
