We are excited to announce that Filecoin Foundation is hosting our first-ever Orbit University Challenge, a competition for university blockchain organizations to propose and design decentralized AI applications leveraging the Filecoin network. This challenge explores how decentralized storage can power AI models, enhance privacy, and drive impactful, real-world solutions. The winning team will receive two all-expenses-paid tickets to ETH Denver 2025 to present their idea and network with the global blockchain community.

## Challenge Brief

Develop a concept for a decentralized AI application that uses Filecoin as the storage layer. Your proposal should demonstrate how Filecoin's decentralized storage infrastructure can solve challenges like:

Scalable data storage for AI models and datasets.

Privacy-preserving AI through encrypted, distributed data handling.

Data integrity and reliability using blockchain-based proofs to verify data availability.

Cost-efficiency for AI applications that require large-scale data and model storage.

Participants should focus on a real-world problem that can be addressed through this combination of AI and decentralized infrastructure.

### Why DeAI?

More organizations are shifting toward closed and opaque training models, raising concerns about power concentration, and creating information silos and centralized control that expose data to vulnerabilities. The lack of transparency in these systems obscures crucial aspects of AI development, including details on data sources and training methodologies.

The Filecoin network offers an alternative to centralized models by enabling decentralization of resources and transparency into model data ‚Äì‚Äì addressing the pressing need for open AI systems fortified by resilient digital infrastructure: the key to data provenance, authenticity, and verifiability in the high-frequency information age.

### How to Participate

#### 1. Develop Your Idea:

Create a concept for a decentralized AI application that leverages Filecoin‚Äôs storage network. Think creatively: The application could target healthcare, supply chain, media, finance, or research collaboration.

#### 2. Submit Your Proposal:

Provide a 500-700 word summary of your concept, outlining:

- The problem being solved.
- The role of decentralized AI and Filecoin in your solution.
- Technical feasibility and impact of your project.

Submit the proposal via a designated portal and post a short description on X (formerly Twitter) with the hashtag #DecentralizedAIChallenge and tag [@FilFoundation](https://twitter.com/FilFoundation). Then, join the [Filecoin Discord](https://discord.gg/filecoin) community.

**_Submission Deadline: All entries must be submitted by November 30, 2024._**

#### 3. Inspiration Examples

- Healthcare Federated Learning System: A privacy-preserving AI model trained across hospitals, with encrypted patient data stored on Filecoin.
- Supply Chain Forecasting Tool: An AI-powered system that analyzes supply chain data stored across decentralized nodes to predict demand and mitigate risks.
- Decentralized AI Model Repository: A platform where AI researchers share and retrieve models using Filecoin, ensuring availability and version control through blockchain-backed proofs.

Subject to rules below.

### Rules

**The following rules (the ‚ÄúOfficial Rules‚Äù) govern the submission of each entry to the Filecoin Orbit University Challenge (the ‚ÄúCompetition‚Äù), sponsored by Filecoin Foundation (the ‚ÄúFoundation‚Äù).**

**Eligibility:** The competition is open to anyone who is a member of a University blockchain organization with the exception that no previous or current employees of Filecoin Foundation (or their immediate families or current household members) may participate. Participants by the start of the competition must have reached the age of 18 or of majority in their state/country of residence. By proposing and submitting a design, participants are entering this contest and agree to abide by all rules and that all decisions of the Foundation are final. Void where prohibited by law.

**Contest Schedule:** Contest begins on or about 9:00am (PT) on November 5, 2024 and ends at 11:50pm PT on November 30, 2024. Only entries submitted during this period will be eligible to win.

**Winners:** Winners will be chosen by the Foundation based on quality of submissions and announced approximately 15 days after the competition has closed. If a winner cannot be reached or does not claim their prize within fourteen (14) days, another winner may be selected.The winner‚Äôs name and social media username may be posted on the social media profiles of the Foundation after the winner has been selected.

**Rewards:** Grand prize winner will receive 2 conference tickets to ETH Denver 2025 main event and reimbursement for travel expenses to the event up to $1500 USD. Grand prize winner will maintain, and make available to the Foundation upon request, accurate and complete records of receipts and expenditures.

Grand prize winner must be available to travel February 27 - March 2, 2025. If Grand Prize Winner cannot do so for any reason, Grand Prize will be forfeited without compensation of any kind, and an alternate winner may be selected. Grand Prize Winner is solely responsible for all other expenses related to the trip.
