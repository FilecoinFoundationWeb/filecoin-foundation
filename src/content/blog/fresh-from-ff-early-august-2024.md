## Early August Highlights

üßá The Nv23 Upgrade, codenamed "Waffle," is arriving on Mainnet on August 6. The upgrade was successfully deployed to the calibnet on July 11, and will feature 6 FIPs including [FIP0065](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0065.md), [FIP0079](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0079.md), [FIP0084](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0084.md), [FIP0085](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0085.md), [FIP0091](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0091.md), and [FIP0092](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0092.md). Stay tuned to the [Filecoin Governance X](https://x.com/fil_gov) account for the latest updates.

üáπüá≠ It's Official: The Filecoin community is heading to Bangkok. Dive into decentralized AI infrastructure, DePIN, and the evolving data economy at FIL Bangkok.

[Reserve your spot](/events/fil-bangkok) now and keep an eye out for programming announcements.

üî≠ Take the tour of the brand-new [fil.org](/)! FF's website got a redesign to make it easier than ever to explore the ever-expanding Filecoin community featuring new pages and content, faster load times, and better searchability. Whether you're browsing decentralized projects and use cases or looking for ways to get involved with the network, get started at [fil.org](/).

## Ecosystem

### Builders Funnel

Due to popular demand, the [Developer Working Group](https://github.com/filecoin-project/DeveloperWG) will begin meeting monthly. The DevWG is an opportunity for developers, community members, researchers, and others interested in the development of the Filecoin protocol to come together to discuss the most important topics among developers. Join the [#dev-wg](https://filecoinproject.slack.com/archives/C06G5K8H3J7) Slack channel to get the latest news on the meetups.

- Thanks for joining us at the [ETHGlobal Brussels hackathon](https://ethglobal.com/events/brussels/prizes#filecoin)! The Filecoin track received 35 submissions across all three categories: AI tools, data apps, and privacy tools. Visit [hackathons.filecoin.io](http://hackathons.filecoin.io/) to join an upcoming hackathon and help shape the future of the web.

### Storage

- Interested in the latest developments for Filecoin Storage Providers? Join the [#global-storage-provider-community](https://filecoinproject.slack.com/archives/C02GQUMFQVA) Slack channel to get involved in weekly SP discussions and stay informed on updates from across the Filecoin community.
- Head of Community Porter Stowell joined the [Off-Chain Podcast](https://youtu.be/YCXgEG0Pva8?si=5bYkc2gIn2JhK0_U) to discuss some of the hottest topics in the ecosystem, including how Filecoin is tackling the ever-growing demand for data storage driven by AI advancements.

## Network Operations

### Governance

- Join the community [governance conversation](/governance)! In the Filecoin ecosystem, governance refers to the rights, rules, processes, and norms that empower community members to collectively determine the development of the protocol. Anyone is welcome to participate through the monthly [Community Governance calls](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=c_909343f97c15e8f23dda6e2612e62fcdee14bceabd8869abe4a52d793bf42b98%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FToronto), the [Fil-Gov Slack](https://filecoinproject.slack.com/archives/C0535S9TUUF) channel, [Metropolis](/blog/empowering-governance-the-launch-of-metropolis-to-the-filecoin-community), or attending a [Filecoin event](/events).
- [FIP0086: Fast Finality in Filecoin](https://x.com/fil_gov/status/1816907389200924988) is now in Last Call. This FIP proposes to significantly speed up the time it takes for Filecoin transactions to be considered final and irreversible, reducing transaction times from 7.5 hours to just a few seconds.

### Fil Plus

- Rolling allocator applications are open for submissions. Allocators are a core part of the Fil+ program and help incentivize the storage of useful data on the Filecoin network. Visit the [FIDL blog](https://blog.allocator.tech/2024/05/rolling-applications-are-open-for.html) for application instructions and a walkthrough.
- [The Fil+ page](/filecoin-plus) is live on fil.org. Learn about the purpose of Fil+ and how to become an allocator, and explore DataCap projects within the program.
- The FIL Plus team is conducting audits on the initial 5 Pib of DataCap distribution as part of the ongoing DataCap refresh. These allocators will either receive a full, partial, or no DataCap refresh.
