Project Dokaz is a set of accountability efforts in Ukraine that applies Starling Lab's work with especially vulnerable digital records. Starling Lab, with social enterprise Hala Systems, submitted a novel cryptographic dossier documenting possible war crimes in Kharkiv, Ukraine to the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC). For every piece of evidence, metadata was registered using L1 protocols, and the files themselves were cryptographically preserved using the Filecoin network, showcasing how Web3 empowers end-users to compose solutions across new tamperproof digital protocols and create auditable chains of custody.

Starling Lab is the academic research lab innovating with the latest cryptographic methods and decentralized web protocols to meet the technical and ethical challenges of establishing trust in our most sensitive digital records.
