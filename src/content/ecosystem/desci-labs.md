Solving science’s “Replication Crisis” is the basis of the work by DeSci Labs using decentralized technologies like IPFS and Filecoin. This technology operates "under the hood" of its scientific publication app called DeSci nodes. By storing research objects that contain manuscripts, datasets, code, presentations, videos or other relevant research artifacts in a decentralized repository, it becomes possible to share the entire research set with data and code, provide versioning, and ensure reproducibility.
