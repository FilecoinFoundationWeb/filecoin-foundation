FoxWallet is a safe and easy-to-use decentralized wallet, dedicated to creating an entrance and connection to the Web3 world. FoxWallet strives to provide a reliable and an industry-leading storage solution with encryption. By accommodating multiple chains and various sets of mnemonics, and ensuring compatibility with other wallets in terms of mnemonics and addresses, FoxWallet aims to empower users in conveniently managing multiple accounts with a single set of seed phrases while keeping every address independent of each other.

As a decentralized wallet, the mnemonics and private keys of users are stored locally with the help of distributed individual nodes, instead of being uploaded to a centralized server. FoxWallet essentially wants to empower users to be in control of their own private keys and seed phrases, further lowering the risk of theft and censorship.
