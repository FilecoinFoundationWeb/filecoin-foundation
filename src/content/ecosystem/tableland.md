Tableland is a Web3 database to store and query contract metadata with (structured query language) SQL. With Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM) compatibility, Tableland developers can build on Filecoin, enabling Web3-native mutability and queries to data written by smart contracts, such as deal data or file metadata.
