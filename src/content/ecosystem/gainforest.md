GainForest is a non-profit focused on reversing deforestation and climate change through blockchain technology. They are building a decentralized Transparency Hub that makes environmental data and models accessible for everyone, leveraging the Filecoin network. The hub lets anyone explore the quality of nature-based solutions such as mangrove plantings in the Philippines or support for indigenous communities in Amazon rainforest protection. The hub also provides an economic opportunity for local communities to participate in the digital economy by empowering them to contribute field-based data.
