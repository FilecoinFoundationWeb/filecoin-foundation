FILLiquid is a liquidity pool is implemented on FVM (Filecoin Virtual Machine) as a fully open-sourced, decentralized, algorithmic-based lending platform. As a winner of the Defi Rocket in ETH Global FVM Space Warp hackathon, FILLiquid aims to provide solutions to the dilemma of pledging by facilitating a market for FIL token holders to earn passive income, and for SPs to borrow FIL token to achieve power growth.
