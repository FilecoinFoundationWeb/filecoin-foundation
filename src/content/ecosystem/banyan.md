Banyan is making decentralized, content-addressed storage accessible for enterprise clients on the Filecoin network, with a focus on user-controlled privacy and verifiability. The company provides both hot and cold storage options for users with significant amounts of data, leveraging both Filecoinâ€™s network of storage providers and its cryptographic proofs of storage to give users confidence in the continued security and longevity of their data.
