TRES.Finance was created two years ago to fill a gap in the market for an enterprise grade accounting, audit, fund admin, and treasury management platform with 100% coverage of web3 assets and activities. We pull in Filecoin's transactional data then add accounting and finance contextual layers to it, like cost basis, realized gains, unrealized gains, and PnL impact.
