The Starling Lab is the academic research lab innovating with the latest cryptographic methods and decentralized web protocols to meet the technical and ethical challenges of establishing trust in our most sensitive digital records. Starling Lab has worked with many different organizations and fellows on data integrity projects across the domains of history, journalism, and law and incorporates the Filecoin network to support data provenance and authenticity.
