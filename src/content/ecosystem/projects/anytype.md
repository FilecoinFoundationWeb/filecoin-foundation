Meet Anytype, a private hub for all your data: docs, tasks, files, bookmarks, contacts, and more. Itâ€™s built on a new architecture that protects your privacy and data sovereignty, even when working across devices. Use it to create elegant dashboards, documents, and knowledge graphs.

By developing a tool where anyone can create and share without an intermediary, our hope is to demonstrate a system wherein cooperation can flourish without third-party intervention, oversight, and control. We use a private [IPFS](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/what-is-ipfs/) network to handle storage.
