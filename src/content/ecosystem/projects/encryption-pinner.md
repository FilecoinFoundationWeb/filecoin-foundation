Encryption Pinner utilizes Node's "crypto" module for fast file encryption via the web browser. Users can choose between dozens of encryption methods, with a passcode of their choice.

Upon encrypting a file, it will be pinned to Pinata using a custom Pinata gateway. From there, users can retrieve their encrypted files in the same way they would retrieve any other IPFS hosted content. The files can then be decrypted using the passcode the user entered initially.
