Solmedia is the first decentralized content sharing platform on Solana. Integrating both Solana and Filecoin on-chain IPFS technology, Solmedia ensures a secure video streaming experience for content creators and consumers

across Web 3.0. Watch videos, create content and monetize your community on the Solmedia platform with zero censorship, fully on-chain.

Video storage and data are implemented via new Filecoin IPFS & Farcaster technology to maximize anonymity and maintain a non-central approach for the platform and its users. Our end-goal is to revolutionize online entertainment by providing a privacy focused & free speech web 3.0 video platform that excludes the flaws commonly found in centralized big tech social media.
