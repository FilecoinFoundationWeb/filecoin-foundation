As a Web3 company, BackedBy allows creators the freedom to start their own content platform on the blockchain. We believe that creators deserve to be paid fairly, without having to pay outrageous fees to existing platforms. Blockchain offers the opportunity for a creator to share content on a custom platform, complete with payment processing and access control. BackedBy streamlines this process for a 1% fee, which is used for continuous improvement and development. Creators make projects on the blockchain using BackedByâ€™s Smart Contracts. Any posts they add to their projects are encrypted and stored on a tool called IPFS.
