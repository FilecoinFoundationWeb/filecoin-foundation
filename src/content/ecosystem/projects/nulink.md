NuLink is a ZK Provable Data Privacy Solution for DApps.

In the Web3 era, data privacy protection is crucial. We are on a mission to build a solution that makes it easy for developers to implement best practices and best-of-breed data security and privacy. Today it is complicated (sometimes expensive) to implement security and encryption of personal data.

Our project aims to offer the world an out-of-the-box encryption solution that makes it easy to implement best practices and modern and up-to-date security. The solution will offer everything needed including data encryption, key & storage management, inter-blockchain deployment, and much more.

We use the Filecoin network to allow users to store their encrypted files.
