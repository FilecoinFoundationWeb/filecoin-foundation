Audius is a music and audio-sharing platform designed to provide artists with a direct link to their listeners. Using decentralized technology, Audius is able to ensure artists’ rights to and control over their own music. Audius leverages IPFS for content-based addressing, decentralized storage, and easy implementation. Audius ensures artists’ rights to and control of their own content and distribution of artists' work without the need to go through a record label.
