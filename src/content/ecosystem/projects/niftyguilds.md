NiftyGuilds is a web3 based NFT gated group chat platform with blockchain-level security. NiftyGuilds is a permissionless NFT-gated group chat DApp, where users simply need to connect their wallet and NiftyGuilds will detect the NFTs in the wallet to enroll the user into the corresponding servers to chat.
