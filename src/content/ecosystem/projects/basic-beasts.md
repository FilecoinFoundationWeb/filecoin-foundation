Created by 10-year-old gamer beastkid21 and his brother, bz, who took their inspiration from the popularity of beloved classics like Pokémon and Tamagotchi, Basic Beasts aims to bring fun back to gaming while enabling players to profit from their participation. Basic Beasts delivers an interactive NFT collectibles game experience, using IPFS through pinata.cloud to host its NFTs.
