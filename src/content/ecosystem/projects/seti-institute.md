The SETI Institute is a non-profit research organization with the mission to lead humanity's quest to understand the origins and prevalence of life and intelligence in the universe and share that knowledge with the world. In their continuing search for extraterrestrial life, the SETI Institute uses Filecoin to safeguard their data and is storing 60+ GiBs of data, including a decoded ET transmission.
